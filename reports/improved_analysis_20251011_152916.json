I own the Kobalt 40v chainsaw and pole saw. I\u2019m a home owner not a homesteader.  I like the battery saws a lot. That brings me to this beast, 94cc  395xp I am working on now. It has a 36\u201d bar. I\u2019m cleaning and fixing it up to re-sell. It was part of an estate auction I won. I\u2019m not keeping it.. (but it\u2019s soo bad ass) I\u2019d love to have any info about it, who might be a buyer (loggers and disaster specialists I\u2019m guessing) and what it is worth. I\u2019m finding them on eBay for over 1k for power head only but is that this saw or a sub model or variant? Looks the same. I\u2019m working on it now, it\u2019s been sitting for a while but I think it\u2019s been used very little, it\u2019s a 2020 model year.\nThanks for any feedback! Happy and Safe Cutting \n",

Our new place had some brand-new Bosch or GE but my wife wanted to swap and keep the Miele. So I did. No joke here, the Miele weighs literally twice as much as any other dishwasher.\n\nThe other week, it started showing signs of finally being ready to go - cycles failing, fault codes etc. To my surprise, despite being 20 years old, Miele still makes parts for it. Not only that, but the full 200+ page service manual is published online, detailing exactly how to check fault codes and what each code means, how to access every part, circuit diagrams, water flow diagrams, etc. The parts definitely aren't being sold completely at cost but they're not egregious either.\n\nThe issue turned out to be some O-rings that disintegrated on a valve on the sump, causing the drain pump to",

        "selftext": "Hi, first post in this sub. I have had the pleasure of using many 2stroke saws that my father has shared with me, poulan pro, Smaller Husqvarna saws. I own the Kobalt 40v chainsaw and pole saw. I\u2019m a home owner not a homesteader.  I like the battery saws a lot. That brings me to this beast, 94cc  395xp I am working on now. It has a 36\u201d bar. I\u2019m cleaning and fixing it up to re-sell. It was part of an estate auction I won. I\u2019m not keeping it.. (but it\u2019s soo bad ass) I\u2019d love to have any info about it, who might be a buyer (loggers and disaster specialists I\u2019m guessing) and what it is worth. I\u2019m finding them on eBay for over 1k for power head only but is that this saw or a sub model or variant? Looks the same. I\u2019m working on it now, it\u2019s been sitting for a while but I think it\u2019s been used very little, it\u2019s a 2020 model year.\nThanks for any feedback! Happy and Safe Cutting \n",

Want a semi-decent blower for all the leaves coming off the trees aswell as the HUGE amount of acorns we have this year!\n\nThe strimmer will be for overgrown grass, nettles, brambles and the likes, not as much for edge-ing the lawn, so again something semi-decent.\n\nThere is so much in their lineup I just get abit lost! Any advice welcomed, thanks!\n\nEDIT: UK Post",

        "selftext": "We recently had a water leak (thankfully fixed now), but part of the repair involved removing drywall,  releasing an old, nasty smoke smell from the previous owners. The house always had a bit of that odor, but now it\u2019s way stronger and pretty unbearable.\n\nOur church offered to let us borrow their ozone generator to help get rid of the smell. At the same time, the restoration crew we hired still has dehumidifiers and a couple of fans running to heat and dry out the area so we don\u2019t end up with mold under the floors.\n\nWe\u2019re not currently living in the house while all this is going on, and the AC system is turned off. So my question is: is it safe to run the ozone generator while those other machines are operating, as long as no one\u2019s inside? I just don\u2019t want to risk damaging the equipment or create any unsafe conditions.\n\nAny info on ozone generators, general advice, or firsthand experience would be super appreciated. We\u2019re first time homeowners and learning as we go here!",

The biggest part is the kitchen which includes taking down a few walls. They've already gutted the walls down to the studs and today they actually take down the walls. They have put up plastic all around the kitchen and I leave the house during their working hours. I try to keep the windows open, we have an air purifier, they vacuum when theyre done and I do an extra round when they leave just to get the thin layer of dust left behind. What else should I be doing? Should I even sleep here at night? We have a 6 year old as well. Should I be wearing a mask even when they're not here, but when I'm relaxing at night? I just want to keep myself safe but I don't think I can move myself out of the house completely. ",
