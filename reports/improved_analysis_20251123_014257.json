I just cant shake the feeling that 500w just isnt enough, but at the same time know there is no standard for what numbers manufacturer's can throw on the box.\n\nWhich would be the better option?  Or are there other electric options i should be looking at?\nIt feels very much comparing an entry level of a commercial brand against the top of the line of a consumer brand. \n\nLong term, id also be getting a hedge trimmer, articulating hedge trimmer, wipper snipper and a leaf blower. So the quality of the whole eco system would also be super important.\n\nThanks!!",

I've read about the auger failing to engage or the unit stalling out in very cold conditions, which some users attributed to the electronics/control board or the batteries getting too cold.\n2. **Chute Control Issues:** I've seen mentions of the chute directional control being too loose or too tight, making it difficult to aim or causing it to swing wildly when hitting heavy snow.\n3. **Storage:** My snow blower would be stored in an unheated shed outside. I know Ryobi recommends storing the batteries indoors at room temperature, but ",

So, I had a look and came across the Makita 199901-8 BCD Tool Bag for Stick Vacuums. Took a punt at \u00a320 thinking if it didn\u2019t fit I\u2019ll just use it for something else. Well it turns out that it fits the polisher perfectly. So just an idea for anybody else who maybe wanting a case for the polisher. Consider the above. Plenty of storage for polish and compound, perfect size for the 6in pads and a place for a charger and batteries (though mine are in another box). ",

I\u2019m sweeping constantly and still finding little tumbleweeds everywhere. My current vacuum is bulky, loud, and takes up half my coat closet, so every time I use it, it feels like a whole operation, unwinding the cord, dragging it around, and then struggling to store it again afterward.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about switching to a cordless vacuum because the idea of grabbing something light and quick sounds perfect for a small space with a shedding pet. But I\u2019m still unsure if they\u2019re actually strong enough for real daily cleaning or if they clog easily with long hair. For anyone who\u2019s made the switch, I\u2019d love to know how the suction and battery hold up in real use, and whether you felt the price you paid was worth it. I\u2019m also curious what price range people usually buy theirs at, an",

I just cant shake the feeling that 500w just isnt enough, but at the same time know there is no standard for what numbers manufacturer's can throw on the box.\n\nWhich would be the better option?  Or are there other electric options i should be looking at?\nIt feels very much comparing an entry level of a commercial brand against the top of the line of a consumer brand. \n\nLong term, id also be getting a hedge trimmer, articulating hedge trimmer, wipper snipper and a leaf blower. So the quality of the whole eco system would also be super important.\n\nThanks!!",

I've read about the auger failing to engage or the unit stalling out in very cold conditions, which some users attributed to the electronics/control board or the batteries getting too cold.\n2. **Chute Control Issues:** I've seen mentions of the chute directional control being too loose or too tight, making it difficult to aim or causing it to swing wildly when hitting heavy snow.\n3. **Storage:** My snow blower would be stored in an unheated shed outside. I know Ryobi recommends storing the batteries indoors at room temperature, but ",

The current string trimmer is a 40v B&D, but it doesn't seem that great.  I've been looking at the LTX 36v power heads to replace it and add the pole hedger and edger.  I've also been looking for a small chainsaw for stuff around the house and camping/off-roading.  We don't have a big yard my any means, maybe 500 square feet of pavers and grass and the string trimmer is used to get up against the fence.  Will the 18v deal here feel like a downgrade in power from the 40v B&D, or should I just go with the 36v and forego the free chainsaw kit?  OR would Makita honor the chainsaw kit if I bought a 36v power head kit?",
