As that is bound to add more weight/complexity to the tool.\n\nBut there needs to be a dial to control the torque setting, so various screws can be driven into various materials.  (including like the porous crispy IKEA furniture😁)  So it does not need to have a massive high torque ability, as we have other screwdriver/hammer drill combo tools already with this, for the fewer times such is required for making heavy woodworks etc. \n\nBut more like a more gentle and more handy Makita screwdriver tool here maybe using just like their lighter 2Ah LXT batteries also, to ease the weight and making it more handy.  We have already many tools from Makita using the LXT range of batteries, reason why it would maybe make sense to get a dedicated screwdriver from same 'battery family'.\n\nOr is it worthwhile to buy instead one of the particular Makita screwdrivers that has i",

I have just suffered through it for these past years because it was expensive and frankly with climate change there is less snow than in past years. \n\nIs there any after market solutions or anything I can do to help fix this?

Plus, specs like CADR and sensor performance matter far more in actual use than marketing blurbs.\n\nSo I’m looking for up-to-date air purifiers that are genuinely worth buying *for life,* units with robust build quality, reliable true HEPA filtration, good long-term support, and filters that are easy to find and reasonably priced. Ideally these are models people have *owned or used for years* and still consider a solid choice instead of something trending for six months.\n\nNo preference for bells and whistles (Wi-Fi/LEDs etc.), just what works well long term and why, especially things that hold up in real daily use, not just on paper.",
