My use-case just isn\u2019t there. Having these tools in them actually makes them quite heavy and tough to access from that bottom shelf in my workbench. I\u2019m just an average dude looking for nice tool storage at my home.\n\nWhat got me looking into these is that I didn\u2019t have a case for that reciprocating saw nor the sander. The standard case that originally came with the drills is actually quite functional and way smaller and lighter. Of course not as heavy duty. At the price of these two boxes, $160, I could probably hunt down a brushless Makita saw with a case included somewhere. I do love that saw I already have though, it kicks ass. One of my most prized possessions.\n\nTo get everything loaded into these two boxes I had to take most of the organizers out of them. The organizer I ",

I'm looking for somewhere with actual inventory, decent pricing, and ships reasonably fast.

The only things I have had die on me are batteries, and that was only 2 out of the 30+ I have. Last spring I jumped on the BOGO deal for the FlexVolt DCST972 kit with a free 9Ah battery from Home Depot for $329. It seemed like a no-brainer since I planned on getting the pole saw at some point in the future, and with a 2-pack of 9Ah batteries selling for $399 (or $349 on sale), I thought why not get a \"free\" string trimmer to go with it. After a season of use, I love it so far. Tons of power and great battery life. I have 320 feet of privacy fence and I can easily trim the grass on both sides and around the rest of my yard/house on a single battery.\n\nThe one attachment that I wish I had is not made by anyone that uses the universal attachment system.

A lot of that advice is from posts 2-5 years old.\n\nOf course I also find posts saying to avoid Frigidaires and GEs too\u2026 seems like every fridge brand has problems these days unless you go for the high end brands. Is there really that much difference between a Samsung/LG and a Frigidaire? Is there just more stuff in the former that can break which causes the unreliability perception? \n\nHas the advice to avoid LG and Samsung changed in recent years?

So I bit the bullet and went to team DeWalt. All was good and I added a couple of DeWalt tools to the arsenal. Now I need to caulk at least a million miles of trim and never being any good with a hand squeeze gun I wanted to get a battery model.  The big teams all want a small fortune, so I just joined Team Cheap, Harbor Freight. All in tool, battery and charger was less than half what the other teams wanted for the tool alone. I've put a couple of tubes through it and the cheap Harbor Freight caulk gun is my new favorite tool.  I can run 20 feet of near perfect bead as quickly as I can walk.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve joined team Bauer there\u2019s a whole new world of tools I had never considered before. Proprietary batteries suck but it\u2019s the world I live in. ",
