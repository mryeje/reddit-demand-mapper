There is also an 18v version.\n\nOn an unrelated topic (xD) I\u2019ve wanted to get some nice cordless tools for a while (hammer drill, impact driver, reciprocating multitool, and some fun stuff like a flashlight and USB charger).\n\nSince I\u2019ve had DeWalt corded tools in the past, I kind of always thought I\u2019d go with them (\u201cone of these days\u201d), but since Makita seems to be the only company that sells an upright vacuum in the entire honking Philippines, it seemed like a perfect excuse.\n\nBut how often would I use the heavy vacuum battery on a tool, or the low-capacity tool batteries in the vacuum?

I have flex volt tools and batteries so it is reasonable to buy flexvolt saw. But\u2026\nIt seems to me people really opinionated about this particular saw even among those who like dewalt tools in general. I\u2019ve watched maybe a dozen of videos and I\u2019ve read reviews. Generally it\u2019s \u201cmixed reviews\u201d to say the least. \n\nAs far as I understand main problems are:\n1. **Bad tracks.** But it can run on festool track so I don\u2019t understand why even bother. I can buy festool tracks even cheaper than dewalt ones. So no issues here\n2. **Weird plunge mechanism.** I didn\u2019t try it in person but it looks alright to me. Yeah it\u2019s obviously different from other saws but I sure can live with it. And this is my first track saw ever, so I don\u2019t even need to get used to it really\n3. **Cumbersome blade change.** Many people complain that blade changing on the Dewalt is a major pain.

I immediately went to the big box store websites and looks like most saws in the $500-$700 range are all Jobsite/portable saws. The one catching my eye is the 10\u201d Dewalt DWE7941.\n\nI consider myself a lower intermediate DIY\u2019r with aspirations to one day make something beautiful. My only experience with table saws is w/ the contractor Ridgid saw and I loved how solid and stable it felt cutting longer boards. Would you be happy going from a larger form factor contractor saw to a bench top/portable saw? I know the Dewalt comes with a fold up stand but does using something made for portability give you the same feel as something larger?  \n  \nMy shop is too small for a larger bench style Grizzly so that\u2019s definitely out of the question and price range. I see lots of people who build a workbench around their saw but is the experience of ripping down sheets or using a sled similar? What is your experience using a smaller saw ",

My only experience with table saws is w/ the contractor Ridgid saw and I loved how solid and stable it felt cutting longer boards. Would you be happy going from a larger form factor contractor saw to a bench top/portable saw?

It has a 36\u201d bar. I\u2019m cleaning and fixing it up to re-sell. It was part of an estate auction I won. I\u2019m not keeping it.. (but it\u2019s soo bad ass) I\u2019d love to have any info about it, who might be a buyer (loggers and disaster specialists I\u2019m guessing) and what it is worth. I\u2019m finding them on eBay for over 1k for power head only but is that this saw or a sub model or variant? Looks the same. I\u2019m working on it now, it\u2019s been sitting for a while but I think it\u2019s been used very little, it\u2019s a 2020 model year.\nThanks for any feedback! Happy and Safe Cutting \n",

Want a semi-decent blower for all the leaves coming off the trees aswell as the HUGE amount of acorns we have this year!\n\nThe strimmer will be for overgrown grass, nettles, brambles and the likes, not as much for edge-ing the lawn, so again something semi-decent.\n\nThere is so much in their lineup I just get abit lost! Any advice welcomed, thanks!\n\nEDIT: UK Post",

The reason was that the compressors weren\u2019t pumping refrigerant around the system. Fast forward to this week, I replaced the tandem compressors, contactors, and filter drier.  Pressure tested, and pulled a vacuum after. When I go to turn on the unit, the compressors still isn\u2019t pumping refrigerant. The pressures are from the unit is on. What am I overlooking?",
