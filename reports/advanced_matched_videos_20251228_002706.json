        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I'm looking for recent opinions on the LS 002g, XGT. 216mm.\n\nI've seen reports that the Makita LS002g cuts with deflection, or that the screw that tightens the bevel breaks, but these are old reports, and I don't know if they've been resolved.\n\nI also have doubts about the efficiency of dust extraction, with the side flexible hose, both with and without a vacuum cleaner.\n\nExperience regarding the actual battery life is welcome. The vast majority of the work involves cutting wood derivatives such as MDF or HDF, which can be as hard as hardwood.\n\nThe company I work for is investing in new miter saws. We have many brands, mainly DeWalt, but we're investing almost everything in Festool (which is truly high quality, no doubt about it). We already have the Kapex 60, but personally, I really like Makita, although I had a bad experience with a lower-end model recently. This would be the first tool of the 40v battery system.\nThanks",

I'm looking for recent opinions on the LS 002g, XGT. 216mm.\n\nI've seen reports that the Makita LS002g cuts with deflection, or that the screw that tightens the bevel breaks, but these are old reports, and I don't know if they've been resolved.\n\nI also have doubts about the efficiency of dust extraction, with the side flexible hose, both with and without a vacuum cleaner.\n\nExperience regarding the actual battery life is welcome. The vast majority of the work involves cutting wood derivatives such as MDF or HDF, which can be as hard as hardwood.\n\nThe company I work for is investing in new miter saws. We have many brands, mainly DeWalt, but we're investing almost everything in Festool (which is truly high quality, no doubt about it). We already have the Kapex 60, but personally, I really like Makita, although I had a bad experience with a lower-end model recently. This would be the first tool of the 40v battery system.\nThanks",

I also have been looking at the all-in-ones. Reviews feel all over the place, but brands I’m looking at include LG, Samsung, and Electrolux. Family of 5 with 3 daughters that have an INSANE amount of clothes, so I need something with the durability to get through a couple loads of laundry daily. I’m looking for user experience with similar setups. If you had to pick from those 3 brands, which would you choose and why? Ventless vs Vented, we have a vent but it’s a tight space and would not be directly behind the machine, leaving the vent somewhat in the way. Laundry centers vs stacked separates? How about the all-in-ones, they seem to have come a long way and the idea that I don’t have to remember to swap the load is VERY appealing. Finally, any other brands within that budget that we should consider?",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nmy family was so kind to gift me about 800€ to support me with my carving business. My toolset consists mostly of hobby Parkside tools. I went cordless with all my saws and angle grinders. \n\nRight now Im looking for options for professional carving saw. As much as I would love to go cordless it's just way too expensive with brands like Stihl or Husqvarna with MSA 220 and 535i XP being my favorites. Motor saws are not an option due to noise.\n\nSo I figured I could go corded saws. As I don't have much experience with corded saws I came here looking for guidance. I would love to get two saws, one for blocking and one for finer work. I usually make smaller products, such as bowls and vases, getting into sculpting and making benches and such.\n\nExcuse my English, looking forward to your suggestions.\n\nThank You in advance!",

Based on that, I ended up with a Makita DUC306 chainsaw (versatility + existing stock of 18V batteries) and a gas-powered Husqvarna brushcutter.\n\nI spent about four hours working today and wanted to share a few observations and ask one question I couldn’t find a clear answer to on Makita’s site.\n\nObservations:\n\n\t1.\tI strongly dislike the gas Husqvarna — serious buyer’s remorse. In hindsight, I should have gone with the battery Makita model I originally considered. Mainly the fact that you need to breathe the fumes irritates me, plus it’s not that powerful.\n\n\t2.\tThe DUC306 has been more than powerful enough. In mixed use with the brushcutter, I only went through one set of 5Ah batteries, which surprised me. I had three sets with me expecting much higher consumption.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs it possible to swap the DUC306 to a longer bar and corresponding larger/heavier chain?\n\nWhen ",
