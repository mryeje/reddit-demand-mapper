The water drips out, wetting the entire surrounding floor.\nI previously displayed an E31/AquaStop error (probably because the water had ended up in the safety tray), but after leaving it idle, the error disappeared. However, the physical leak from the door continues to occur with every cycle.\nDetails found:\nThe leak is located right at the end of the door on the left side.\nThe seals appear clean and in place.\nThere are no obvious blockages in the filters.\nHas anyone with this model had the same problem?\nCould it be the lower seal (the \"brush\" one) or perhaps a micro-crack in the lower spray arm that shoots water sideways?\nBefore calling official support, I'd like to know if it's a component I can easily replace m",

I have a ton of Makita batteries, so thought why not get a stick vac.  Are they worth it?  Which is the best?  I see run time on most are 7 minutes, then on XLC03ZBX4, it's 33 minutes...seems like a big jump.\n\n  \nI have enough batteries and don't mind change them, I just want something have has great suction.  Thoughts? ",

        "selftext": "Hi all, looking for a small 18v hand vacuum for cleaning out the truck and garage occasionally. Yes I know a shop vac would be best, but I\u2019ve already got a corded one. \n\nLooks like there are 2 options in production.. PCL704 and PCL705. \n\nThe 704 is a little more expensive but has \u201c2x more suction power\u201d and comes with accessories. I see it also has a wet/dry version, the 702.\n\nSo should I just go with the 704? Is it really as no-brainer as it seems or are there any advantages the 705 has besides price? \n\nAny experiences appreciated. Thanks!",
