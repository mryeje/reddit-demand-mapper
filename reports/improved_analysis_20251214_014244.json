I double checked everything was good in regards to overcrowding and blocking airflow. The problem seemed to slowly just get worse over the past week or so. My freezer is currently 35\u00b0 and the refrigerator is hovering around 45\u00b0. I put a very detailed explanation into ChatGPT and it did a really good job of walking me through everything to check. Everything was good except for the coils in the freezer. They are clean and shiny except for a heavy amount of frost/ice on the coil that comes into the top to feed the coil condenser rack situation. ChatGPT is suggesting a sealed system failure with the most likely issue being:\n1. Refrigerant leak in evaporator (most common for this Whirlpool-made Kenmore series)\n2. Weak compressor\n3. Capillary tube partial blockage (rarer but possible)\n\nMy question for the pros out there\u2026\nWhat would you rec",

I schedule a service on Maytag's website which is suspiciously cancelled after about 3 hours.  I schedule again, same result.  I call Maytag service and listen to their hold music for over an hour before I get ahold of someone... after being bumped around two three different people it turns out that despite the website saying that I am within their service area I am, in fact, not.  They offer to give me a credit for ordering parts... so much for \"parts and service\".  I order the part and install, machine starts working again.  Ended up being out of commission for over two weeks due to miscommunications from Maytag.\n\n  \nIssue #2: December 2025 - No more spin cycle.

I'm planning on buying a Ryobi brand reciprocating saw for my mom this Christmas; however, I'm struggling a bit on whether I should get the HP 18V brushless(?) cordless saw, or the 18V saw. I don't understand the difference between each saw. I know she would mostly use the saw to prune a palm tree we have in our front yard, which one would be best for this? I'm also looking into replacement blades. From what I've read, they don't have to be Ryobi brand, but they do have to fit the saw. Does anyone have a preferred brand for the replacement blades that might be cheaper than Ryobi's? I came to Reddit for these questions since I don't have anyone else to ask. I'm not very knowledgeable about tools, and I'm sorry if any of my questions are stupid. Thank you!!",

I schedule a service on Maytag's website which is suspiciously cancelled after about 3 hours.  I schedule again, same result.  I call Maytag service and listen to their hold music for over an hour before I get ahold of someone... after being bumped around two three different people it turns out that despite the website saying that I am within their service area I am, in fact, not.  They offer to give me a credit for ordering parts... so much for \"parts and service\".  I order the part and install, machine starts working again.  Ended up being out of commission for over two weeks due to miscommunications from Maytag.\n\n  \nIssue #2: December 2025 - No more spin cycle.

Five years later, it is out again. Top is refrigerator and bottom is the freezer. Neither works.\n\nModel: LFXC24726S\n\nLG compressors do not last more than 5 years.\n\nI have been told it will cost as much to fix as a new refrigerator. Is this true?

Sure the battery might not last long but it\u2019s a pretty small yard.. unless any one else have any other recs? \n\nAlso for the grass, I\u2019m not sure where to start in terms of reviving if possible or seed on patchy parts. Which seeds and tools are recommended? On the passion fruit vine, I plan on either removing it all or just trimming the heck out of it. Thinking loppers might do the trick?\n\nI\u2019m in Southern California for reference\n\nThanks! \n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m hoping you can help me figure out what\u2019s going on with my shower. I live in a 2013 high-rise condo, and the shower gets daily use. It\u2019s ivory travertine tile, glass door, probably a fiberglass pan, with an exposed shower system (Grohe rain head + handheld).\n\nWhat\u2019s happened so far:\n\n* When I moved in in the Spring, I noticed some discoloration on a tile just **outside the shower**. We had plumbers come in to re-siliconed the pan (not sure if they did a great job though since it already looks a bit worn off). They also checked for cracks in the pan but didn't find any.\n* Around November, I noticed discoloration on the bottom row of tiles **inside the shower**. It may have been slowly developing before but I didn't really notice it until then.\n* I've stopped using the shower since then (I have a second one) and ran a dehumidifier. The inside-shower discoloration has lightened slightly but is still visible.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing the issues inside the shower. Could",

Every time I cleaned with my old vacuum, I'd end up sneezing nonstop and feeling congested for hours. It finally clicked that the problem might not just be the dust. it might be the vacuum pushing it back into the air.  \n  \nso I decided to try one of those higher-end cordless vacuums with a self-emptying base, hoping it would help keep everything more contained. not naming the model in the main post, just sharing my experience so far.  \n  \nWhat's been working,  \n  \nThe suction feels consistently strong, even on carpet. The self-emptying base has been a huge help. yeah, there's a quick burst of noise, but it beats having dust fly everywhere when I'm trying to empty it myself. and honestly, the biggest win is I'm sneezing less after vacuuming.   \n  \nMinor tradeoffs,  \n  \nYou still need to empty the base dustbin every couple weeks or so. Way less frequent than a regular vacuum though, but not fully ha",
