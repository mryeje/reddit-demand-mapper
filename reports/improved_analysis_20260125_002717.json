They are respectively at approximately $2000, $3500, $5000 for the washer dryer combo.\n\nSay the LG lasts 10 years and SQ lasts 30 years\u2026I could invest the $3000 difference for 10 years, buy the latest model in 10 years and another in 20 years, and still come out ahead.\n\nI\u2019ve had nothing but good experiences with LG and even often hated Samsung washing machines. I\u2019ve never had one fail despite owning several of them. Always still performed like new by the time we sell our place. So I\u2019m hoping to understand whether and why I should spring for the premium ones like SpeedQueen. Thanks yall!",

Do I need to cut out the bottom two feet and replace it or is that overkill?\n\nMy wife wants to get one of those fancy air and purifier systems installed but I feel like that\u2019s just masking the problem if there\u2019s actual mold behind the walls.

I\u2019m looking for a few\u00a0local people (Raleigh-Durham NC)\u00a0who would be interested in\u00a0testing it out for about a month or two\u00a0and then filling out a short feedback survey.\n\nThis is\u00a0not a sales pitch\u00a0\u2014 no strings attached; I just need real-world testers to get input before I move into the next round of development.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\n\n* You use your shop vac on a\u00a0regular / near-daily basis\n* Ideally you\u2019re already using a\u00a0higher-end vacuum\u00a0(Festool, Fein, Makita, Milwaukee, etc.) or at least care about things like:\n   * HEPA filtration\n   * auto tool start / power tool activation\n   * fine dust performance\n* You\u2019re willing to actually use the vac in your normal workflow and provide honest feedback.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, drop a comment or DM me and I\u2019ll follow up with details.\n\nThanks!",

They are respectively at approximately $2000, $3500, $5000 for the washer dryer combo.\n\nSay the LG lasts 10 years and SQ lasts 30 years\u2026I could invest the $3000 difference for 10 years, buy the latest model in 10 years and another in 20 years, and still come out ahead.\n\nI\u2019ve had nothing but good experiences with LG and even often hated Samsung washing machines. I\u2019ve never had one fail despite owning several of them. Always still performed like new by the time we sell our place. So I\u2019m hoping to understand whether and why I should spring for the premium ones like SpeedQueen. Thanks yall!",

I usually need 8-10 m3 firewood/year and i need a petrol chainsaw for that.  In my forest, there is mostly black locust,  thickness is around 25-35 cm or 10\"-14\", sometimes little bit bigger.   \n  \nCurrently i use a Makita UC4051 for cutting firewood, it is 6 or 7 years old and works perfectly fine, but i cannot use that in my forest. I will still use this for cutting wood, because light, cheap, mostly maintanance free option.  \n  \nIm currently cannot choose between the likes of  Oleo Mac GS630 / Stihl MS261 / Husqvarna 550xp vs the much cheaper not professional versions, like the Oleo GS560, Stihl MS231 etc..\n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\n",
