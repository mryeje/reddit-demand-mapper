As that is bound to add more weight/complexity to the tool.\n\nBut there needs to be a dial to control the torque setting, so various screws can be driven into various materials.

        "title": "Ryobi Snowblower Handle Lock Incredibly Weak",
        "selftext": "So, ever since I got this thing the handle lock has been incredibly weak. Even the slightest pressure just lets it slide back down whereas pulling it back is really difficult, even unlocked on just the right side for some reason.\n\nI think, just like my mower, Ryobi decided if it's not fully extended it will just shut the snow blower off. Which as you can imagine is incredibly annoying considering pushing against even a little snow pushes the handle down.\n\nI have had it for years and bought it off Amazon, so no returning it. I have just suffered through it for these past years because it was expensive and frankly with climate change there is less snow than in past years. \n\nIs there any after market solutions or anything I can do to help fix this? I have tried tightening everything, nothing is broken. It just seems incredibly poorly designed.  ",

It\u2019s leaking chain oil even with the chain cover on (I thought it would catch any drips).\n\nAlso, I\u2019m about to open my regular 16\u201d chainsaw box (free, thanks Makita eRebate!) is there a proper direction for that? Does it have to be parallel and not hang on a wall?\n\nThanks in advance for advice about both.",

        "selftext": "I know this question gets asked a lot, and I\u2019ve gone through many of the older threads here \u2014 but with how fast air purifier models, filters, and real-world performance evolve, a lot of the \u201cclassic\u201d recommendations are either discontinued, replaced, or much harder to service now. Plus, specs like CADR and sensor performance matter far more in actual use than marketing blurbs.\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for up-to-date air purifiers that are genuinely worth buying *for life,* units with robust build quality, reliable true HEPA filtration, good long-term support, and filters that are easy to find and reasonably priced. Ideally these are models people have *owned or used for years* and still consider a solid choice instead of something trending for six months.\n\nNo preference for bells and whistles (Wi-Fi/LEDs etc.), just what works well long term and why, especially things that hold up in real daily use, not just on paper.",
