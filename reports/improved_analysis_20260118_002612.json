I could build a small area with some foam board around my desk, but the wife isn't really excited about that idea so I'm weighing my options.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is, if I can get myself up off the floor with some insulation, and start to add some foam board to the walls, I should be at least in better shape.\n\nSo here's my plan, and then I've got some questions that I'm hoping you all might have thoughts on. \n\n* DMX air gap over as much of the floor as I can, leaving a slight gap at the walls ^[1]\n* Sika 2'' foam board over the DMX for R-13 on the f",

The other vacuums are too big (and expensive) to buy but this one is ideal.\n\nDo we think they will carry them soon? Or should I just buy it online and where? Shipping for this will kill me with tariffs\u2026\n\nHow much more would the AWS version run than the current non-AWS version?\n\nI can\u2019t even be sure I have the correct model number but I think this is right? Comes with the wheels (which I can get here so doesn\u2019t have to be this version just that\u2019s what I could find as an example and the model number order is different outside the U.S. so I didn\u2019t want to cut the wrong part.\n\nIf the non-AWS had a plug for my AWS adapter that lets me use wired vacs that would be a work-around. But from what I can see it doesn\u2019t have a plug to connect it to power the adapter and trigger the vac to start. ",
