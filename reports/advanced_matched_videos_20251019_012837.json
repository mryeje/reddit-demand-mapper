I'm not necessarily in a rush for these, but figured if it's a good deal, may be worthwhile. Figured a kit like this was worthwhile to get the charger and a couple of decent mAh batteries.\n\nI'm replacing a super old Ryobi brushed drill, and I plan to maybe start doing some minor wood work where I need a drill, orbital sander, possibly a router, definitrly a jigsaw, so thought I'd start looking at some better tools. I really like the ergonomics / feel of Makita.\n\nThis kit is the XPH12Z hammer drill and XDT13Z impact driver.",

DeWalt is having a promotion right now so I want to buy one. What would you recommend for home (deck, renovation, various small projects). I’m looking for versatility as I’d only buy one driver. I like how compact the Atomic series are (could have used that when fastening an electrical box in a tight space). I don’t want to break the bank but I’ve done enough cheap mistakes in my life to understand “Buy once, cry once”.  Thanks!!\n\n———\n\nI ordered the 870.\nI would have never considered it without the input of many contributors. Hydraulic seemed like a novelty - especially for an old guy like me happy with his “fully analog” 2007 Outback with manual transmission.\n\nThe torque seemed low, on paper - but based on comments here and more research on the Interweb, it will most likely be sufficient for my needs. \n\nI also pulled the trigger on the DeWalt cordless/cord",

I like how compact the Atomic series are (could have used that when fastening an electrical box in a tight space). I don’t want to break the bank but I’ve done enough cheap mistakes in my life to understand “Buy once, cry once”.  Thanks!!\n\n———\n\nI ordered the 870.\nI would have never considered it without the input of many contributors. Hydraulic seemed like a novelty - especially for an old guy like me happy with his “fully analog” 2007 Outback with manual transmission.\n\nThe torque seemed low, on paper - but based on comments here and more research on the Interweb, it will most likely be sufficient for my needs. \n\nI also pulled the trigger on the DeWalt cordless/cord",

Figured a kit like this was worthwhile to get the charger and a couple of decent mAh batteries.\n\nI'm replacing a super old Ryobi brushed drill, and I plan to maybe start doing some minor wood work where I need a drill, orbital sander, possibly a router, definitrly a jigsaw, so thought I'd start looking at some better tools.

I have a smaller 14 in Husqvarna saw too will probably use instead as runs better too.  \n\nThe craftsman works well it just seemed kind of ornery to start or would not idle long well. It seems like the parts for the brake should be like $30 or less all I can find if anything is entire covers for like $90+ and I'm not even sure they are a match not being craftsman. That price i think may be better off just junking this and spend a bit more get a better used one or an electric model. Safety sure worth the $ but seems stupid too to spend like 1/2 the cost of a new saw too considering this one is also kind of finicky too maybe better just cut the loss and mov",

It appears condensate is building up on these refrigerant lines near the compressor and then dripping down onto the interior of the appliance. You can see the green build up where it drips from.

The machine does its job, but there's always water leaking from the bottom. I'd appreciate any advice. Is it fixable, or do I just order a new one?",
