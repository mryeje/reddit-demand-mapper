There is also an 18v version.\n\nOn an unrelated topic (xD) I’ve wanted to get some nice cordless tools for a while (hammer drill, impact driver, reciprocating multitool, and some fun stuff like a flashlight and USB charger).\n\nSince I’ve had DeWalt corded tools in the past, I kind of always thought I’d go with them (“one of these days”), but since Makita seems to be the only company that sells an upright vacuum in the entire honking Philippines, it seemed like a perfect excuse.\n\nBut how often would I use the heavy vacuum battery on a tool, or the low-capacity tool batteries in the vacuum?  I can daydream of opportunities, but realistically probably almos",

I have flex volt tools and batteries so it is reasonable to buy flexvolt saw. But…\nIt seems to me people really opinionated about this particular saw even among those who like dewalt tools in general. I’ve watched maybe a dozen of videos and I’ve read reviews. Generally it’s “mixed reviews” to say the least. \n\nAs far as I understand main problems are:\n1. **Bad tracks.** But it can run on festool track so I don’t understand why even bother. I can buy festool tracks even cheaper than dewalt ones. So no issues here\n2. **Weird plunge mechanism.** I didn’t try it in person but it looks alright to me. Yeah it’s obviously different from other saws but I sure can live with it. And this is my first track saw ever, so I don’t even need to get used to it really\n3. **Cumbersome blade change.** Many people complain that blade changing on the Dewalt is a major pain.

My only experience with table saws is w/ the contractor Ridgid saw and I loved how solid and stable it felt cutting longer boards. Would you be happy going from a larger form factor contractor saw to a bench top/portable saw? I know the Dewalt comes with a fold up stand but does using something made for portability give you the same feel as something larger?  \n  \nMy shop is too small for a larger bench style Grizzly so that’s definitely out of the question and price range. I see lots of people who build a workbench around their saw but is the experience of ripping down sheets or using a sled similar? What is your experience using a smaller saw ",

We had an older washer that flooded our home and did a ton of damage. We bought a whirlpool set with removable agitator in 2021 and last week the washer started to leak. Had someone look at it and the cost to repair it would be not worth it. The auto detergent dispenser had already stopped working and we have to tape the dryer door shut with painter tape because it won’t stay shut so it’s not been a good purchase. They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years. I see speed queen stuff all over but I thought my whirlpool would last longer. \n\nI had been looking for an older washer/dryer set but usually they were s",

Take your stock wand off and replace with the male to 1/4 quick connect from this kit. You can then put your female to 1/4 quick connect on the stock wand. This will let you put your foam cannons, other wants, tips etc right on the end of the tool rather than out on a wand. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/eRfIhRR\nThis is the stubby wand shown. Works a treat paired with the now shortened tool. \n\nThe quick connect for water can be removed and swapped for the more common quick connects out there. Be advised, it looks like dewalt used a slightly shorter thread height on the otherwise standard GHT. When you screw your standard GHT quick connects in, it will be tight.

Gas wasn’t dripping out but there was definitely some fuel vapour. I was able to clear it out and it eventually came to life. Idled it for a bit and cut down some trees to help clear out excess fuel. Ran okay and started it up normally that day. \n\nToday I went to start it pulled it on full choke twice (didn’t hear burp but I read that the burp is sometimes hard to catch when the saw is brand new) then went half clutch, heard it catch but the catch was like full speed ahead. It sounded like I was going full throttle. I pressed the gas and then it died. Tried again in the run position and it started and it seemed to run very high idle again, as soon as I pressed the throttle it died. \n\nI remove",

Pressure tested, and pulled a vacuum after. When I go to turn on the unit, the compressors still isn’t pumping refrigerant. The pressures are from the unit is on. What am I overlooking?",
