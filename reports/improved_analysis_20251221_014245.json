When i went to get my own, I saw that I could have gotten the same package with an atomic impact driver and atomic hammer drill for $100 more, so I got that deal and I am going to swap out the original MAX impact driver for the atomic impact driver along with trading one of the 2amp hr batteries for the other 5amp hr battery.\n\n\n\nI will keep the MAX impact driver, the second atomic impact wrench, and 2 of the 3x 2amp hr batteries, and 2amp battery charger.

So far here are the power tools I\u2019ve bought and the lessons I\u2019ve learned.\n\nOverpowered flex volt dewalt drill. Regret this. Yeah it\u2019s powerful but anything past shoulder height or elbow and it\u2019s much more of a work out than I signed up for.\n\nDewalt Atomic impact drill: love this thing.\n\nDewalt flex volt leafblower. It\u2019s powerful but dies fast. Not a regret just because the 9ah battery it came with was probably the real value.\n\nPole trimmer: returned. Hand saw works fine for most things I found.\n\nCircular saw 2x.

Then the next day the dishwasher is running normally and right near the end of the cycle, I hear it beep. Go check it out, h2o error. This happened a few years ago and Reddit helped me figure out the pressure sensor just needed to be cleaned (solved the problem then) so I did that and the h2o error disappeared. However then when I tried to run a cycle, the machine starts up but water doesn\u2019t come in. Also, the light won\u2019t turn on indicating it\u2019s running and when I open the dishwasher mid cycle it doesn\u2019t turn off like it usually does and beep to start again.\n\nI do some research, find it could be the water inlet valve.

I've been having issues with my Milwaukee batteries going missing. Since alot of the farm workers themselves have Milwaukee too for their personal tools- I'm betting they are stealing them. I want to pick my Milwaukee saws up and just buy like a 1-2 cheaper saws like the Stihl or husky battery saws that I know they won't mess with cause they don't own any of those brands in battery form. It's annoying and I know but I have to have battery saws there I can't let them handle gas saws cause some of those guys don't really care and I'm always having to take them to the repair shop! I was wanting to buy say the cheaper husky or Stihl homeowner grade battery saws (msa70 \n/ husky 350 power axe) to keep in my farm tool barn and pick up my Milwaukee chainsaws and take them home with me cause I can't keep buying th",

First use was today. \n\nI was using this on a XUX02 powerhead, which I believe is the least powerful powerhead that the shovel works on. Overall first impression was very positive. We got better 6-8\u201d of snow and it was fairly light. The Makita blew through it like it was nothing and threw it far enough that I wasn\u2019t constantly just cleaning up after myself. It really struggled once I got closer to the road where the snow was ove",

There are so many options, and things like filter type, noise level, coverage area, and maintenance make it kind of overwhelming. \n\nHave any of you found an air purifier that actually made a noticeable difference for your air quality or helped with allergies? I\u2019m looking for something effective, quiet, easy to maintain, and ideally not too expensive. \n\nI\u2019ve seen brands like Dyson, Levoit, Coway, and Blueair mentioned a lot, but I\u2019m still not sure which one\u2019s really the best.

They denied as they claim the dust cannister is a consumable (?!?!?).   This is not a part I would expect to replace in the life of the vacuum.
