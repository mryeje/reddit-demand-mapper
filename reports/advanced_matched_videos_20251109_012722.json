Does it cut well? Is it powerful? I would only get this for the “benefits” of cordless, but the way i see it, attached to a vacuum, its not cordless anyway. \n\nOption 2) makita corded. From my research, these are the best track saw outside of the festool lineup and only 3/4 the price of one.\n\nOption 3) Festool. Obviously the best. But which model do i get? There are like 10. I would probably go corded for now on it since i dont have the lineup. In the future i plan to own the festool 6” orbital sander and the festool domino. But those are long view purchases.  ",

The rise on my shed is a little too high for my mower to drive in (except with a lot of effort) without one. I came across these instructions a while ago and after nearly twisting my ankle exiting the shed yesterday (wasn't watching where I was stepping) I think now's a good as time as any. Problem is, these directions call for using a table saw, which I don't own and neither do my neighbors. I was wondering how I can make the angled cuts without them.\n\nThird bullet of step 3 has you cut about a 4.7 degree angle in the header and vertical blocks. I have a circular saw and jigsaw, but those don't seem like safe options. The problem isn't so much securing the wood while I cut: it's how would I cut a straight line across the top edge of a 2x4 or 2x6? It's too narrow\n\nI had a thought. Some users seem to think plywood won't be strong enough. I realized that ",
