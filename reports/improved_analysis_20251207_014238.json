But nothing to make me worried about water damage. It died after a while so I thought I ran out of power. So I stopped and the next day threw it on the charger and it said it was charging. About 2 weeks later I tried to use the battery and it was broken. \n\nAnd now the battery won\u2019t charge. It flashes the lights when I check the level and the charger stays on error. \n\nMy friend only uses dewalt and he says he\u2019s left them in the rain and nothing happened to them. \n\nSo ryobi batteries have poor water and dust sealing? Considering switching from ryobi if this is true. \n\nOr Is this only an issue with lithium batteries having more components inside?",

        "selftext": "I was disappointed to find that my new Bosch 300-series dishwasher doesn\u2019t include a physical delayed-start button, since it meant having to log into the app every night just to set a delayed cycle. I started looking for ways to automate the process while still keeping the Extra Dry and Sanitize options enabled.\n\nOne user suggested a Google Home automation, but it didn\u2019t work for me. In my region (Canada), the only available actions are to turn the dishwasher on or off at a specific time; there\u2019s no option to actually start a program.\n\nI also tried Alexa Routines, which *could* start a cycle on a schedule, but it always disabled the Extra Dry and Sanitize settings.\n\nThen I discovered IFTTT. Using the free tier, I created a simple trigger to start the Auto program every night at 1 a.m. I tested it, and it worked, plus it retained the Extra Dry and Sanitize options.\n\nAfter that, I disabled Permanent Remote Start on the dishwasher. Now, if I want a delayed start, all I have to do is press",

        "selftext": "Hi, please forgive me if this is a silly or repeated question - I'm a total noob about to move into my first house.\n\nI'm trying to find the right tool for really basic jobs like installing blinds, building furniture, etc. and I'm getting very confused whether the ONE+ HP 18V Brushless Cordless Compact Drill/Driver covers that or whether I need specifically an \"impact driver\" that apparently is better for screws? I have no plans at this time to do heavy duty screwing like building a deck!\n\nSpecifically looking at this: https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-Compact-Drill-Driver-Kit-with-18V-2-0-Ah-HIGH-PERFORMANCE-Battery-and-Charger-PSBDD02K/332250132\n\nThank you for any clarity!\n\nFollow-up question, but any recommended basic set of \"bits\" to purchase for aforementioned basic usage?",

        "selftext": "hello, So I\u2019ve been using a pretty old upright vacuum for years and honestly it\u2019s such a pain dragging it around the house, especially up and down stairs. I\u2019ve been thinking about switching to a cordless one because I like the idea of not having to deal with cords and being able to just grab it for a quick clean.\n\nHas anyone made the switch recently? I\u2019m mainly looking for something that\u2019s strong enough for carpets but still light enough to not feel like a workout every time I use it. Also curious about battery life how long does it usually last before needing a recharge?\n\nI\u2019ve read mixed things about attachments too. Like, do you really need all those extra brushes or is it mostly overkill? And how noisy are these compared to old-school vacuums?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences. Any advice on what to watch out for before buying?",

It\u2019s requiring that I choose either the vacuum or the beater bar to warranty (why not both, what if I\u2019m wrong about where the problem is). And then it seems to suggest I have to pay for shipping for them to check it out?\n\nIs this normal? Am I missing something?",
