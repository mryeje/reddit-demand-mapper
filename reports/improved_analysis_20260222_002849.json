Anyways, I picked this up on black Friday for $50 as a kit, which included the saw, blade, 2ah battery and a charger. \n\nStarting with the saw itself, it is not the one+ HP so it is brushed, I don't notice a smell with the brushes (like you smell on some cheap tools) but the motor does get noticably hotter than the brushless motors I have experience with. It also has a fair amount of vibration in the handle. The tool is balanced fairly well, I didn't have any problems using it for an extended period. The blade it came with, to put it bluntly, is completely useless. It serves more use as a toothpick than a saw blade. It couldn't even cut a 2x4 after about 5 minutes. I purchased some Hercules pruning blades at harbor freight and with those the saw has no problems with cutting up some pretty large tree branches. \n\nAs far as the battery goes",

That doesn\u2018t warrant the premium price for festool.\n\nSo I narrowed it down to the dtd 173 and dtd 201. apart from the higher torque are the big differences?\n\nWhat I could find out is that the 173 seems to be a Bit lighter and has higher vibrations. And the second torque Setting is a lot lower than on the 201 (50nm vs 150nm). Is that relevant or will I only use it on the highest Setting all the time?\n\nIndependent of the Model, would you recommend the 3Ah or 5Ah Batteries for an impact driver? I tend to the 3 Ah because of the weight or would they be empty all the times.\n\nUsage is hobby/semiproffesional. I don\u2019t need it for a living but I live on a farm, so I use it a lot more than pure hobbyist. Every some years there is some wood construction, so sometimes big screws 8x250 mm for example will be used. So far I rented an impact from friends or dril",

Guy opened the back panel to the main board, didn\u2019t bother opening the lower back panel and told me that it was a slow leak/main board issue that it is not fixable and I needed a new fridge and left. He claimed that he saw 6 led flashes and guaranteed that the fridge will die very soon.\n\nAfter he left I kept the back panel open and didn\u2019t see any flashing lights so I decided to open the lower back panel and saw some lint trapped inside so I vacuumed and cleaned it, now the freezer seems to be able to freeze stuff again (-20C on panel setting and was able to hover between -10C and -17C according to the thermometer)\n\nAnyone had similar experiences?

Anyways, I picked this up on black Friday for $50 as a kit, which included the saw, blade, 2ah battery and a charger. \n\nStarting with the saw itself, it is not the one+ HP so it is brushed, I don't notice a smell with the brushes (like you smell on some cheap tools) but the motor does get noticably hotter than the brushless motors I have experience with. It also has a fair amount of vibration in the handle. The tool is balanced fairly well, I didn't have any problems using it for an extended period. The blade it came with, to put it bluntly, is completely useless. It serves more use as a toothpick than a saw blade. It couldn't even cut a 2x4 after about 5 minutes. I purchased some Hercules pruning blades at harbor freight and with those the saw has no problems with cutting up some pretty large tree branches. \n\nAs far as the battery goes",

As it's mature already we decided we may as well get it into shape and use it as it was intended to provide privacy, for as long as we can. Decided to break up cutting back the face of it and topping out the height, to give it time to recover each time after removing so much foliage.\n\nWe already had a Ryobi Expand-IT edge trimmer (the type that allows you to swap the tool that's on the end), so we got the hedge trimmer and pruning saw attachments for it, along with an extension for further reach. We trimmed the face of it perfectly vertical back to the steel lawn edge strip. This left holes here and there, but we hoped that they would fill in with sunlight and epicormic gro",

I had a 4v drill and flashlight from years ago, but they're not compatible with the new models. I hope to be expanding this line up. the glue gun and foam cutter are on my wishlist. There was a sale on the heated seat cushions, but I hesitated and missed it. \ud83d\ude1f And that bike pump looks handy. \n\nfor 18v, only 2 tools. a scrubber and a misting fan. ",

        "selftext": "I've really liked the Ryobi brushless stick vacuum, except for one design flaw. The extension wand is stabilized by two small tabs that are prone to breaking off. Without them the wand becomes more wobbly and can cause the power connectors to intermittently lose connection. Across multiple warranty replacements (mostly for the wheels breaking off on the original model) this has happened to all of them over time. In the 4th image you can see the left tab is missing.\n\nSo I designed a collar that goes around the connection and keeps it much more secure, and doesn't rely on tiny tabs to keep it in place. It can be used on both the bottom and the top connection. Since I had spare heads from the warranty replacements, I replaced a couple screws in the wand with longer screws from the bottom of one of the vacuum heads to keep it in place.\n\n  \nEdit: uploaded the model. You can find it here [https://makerworld.com/models/2399167](https://makerworld.com/models/2399167)",
