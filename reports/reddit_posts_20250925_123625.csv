AskEngineers,Books on building things that don’t need a power source,"Hey everyone,

Engineering freshman here. I want to build something that resembles a music box level of technology, roughly the size of a glasses case - no robotics or battery, just clockwork mechanics, brass, gears and springs. 

upon pressing a button to open the box, an arm would rotate up 90 degrees 
from this _ to this | 
and another push of the button reverses that mechanism, the arms goes back to rest and the box closes. 

I would also then add 1 arm on the left and right side each to do ",3,6,1758738817.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1npk3wo/books_on_building_things_that_dont_need_a_power/,https://reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1npk3wo/books_on_building_things_that_dont_need_a_power/,"['how to', 'recommend']",['battery']
AskEngineers,"Central AC, do I get recycled air from my neighbours?","In an apartment building with central HVAC, my understanding is that everyone’s exhaust air gets mixed together (some fresh air is mixed in) and pumped back in into the apartments as new air. Does that mean that if i’m running an air purifier in my unit, i’m basically purifying the entire building? And i’m basically breathing in other people’s farts?

AskEngineers,3D printing for industrial cycloidal gearbox,"Hi everyone, so I am building a 6dof robot arm from scratch using aluminium and some 3d printed parts. I will use cycloidal gearboxes on all of the joints to increase the torque and precision. I have a small 3 axis cnc machine on which i will make the components.

I have a very limited budget for the robot, so to spend less on bigger motors and raw aluminium i decided to make the outer housing of the cycloidal gearbox from petg or abs. Only the outside will be 3d printed along the motor covers a",2,5,1758648658.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nonr31/3d_printing_for_industrial_cycloidal_gearbox/,https://reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nonr31/3d_printing_for_industrial_cycloidal_gearbox/,['budget'],['torque']

It has these spinning scoops on the back that are connected to the wheels by belts. We cannot figure out what this had been used for in the past. The spinning implements don’t touch the ground so its not some kind of tiller. Maybe for chewing up and spreading hay?
