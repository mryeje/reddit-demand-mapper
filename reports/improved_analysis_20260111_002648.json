High priced high margin products can and usually do out-market lower priced lower margin products so I'm always skeptical of the \"influencer darlings\". Sawstop/Festool can spend $50 per saw/domino in advertising where as a Skil or DeWalt are likely spending 1/10th. \n\nSo in an effort to sort out how likely I am to have a table saw accident, I've tried to find statistics regarding accidents as a percentage of table saw users. I'm not really happy with what I've found, so please review. \n\nI fully respect and understand usually follow the tenets \"better to have it and not need it,...\" and \"buy once, cry once\", but I'm spending noticeable amounts of cash on tools I know I'll need often (track saw, miter, router, router lift, drill press, planer...) and I'm not seeing the table saw as a primary tool. \n\nAnyway on to the plot (resource links bel",

The owners are doing a $1.2 million remodel and the contractors were the ones giving it away. They said it was working fine.  There was a lot of interest in it, so I could dilly dally on asking a lot of questions before committing to it. I live in a very affluent place so it\u2019s not uncommon for people to give away things worth a lot of $$.\n\nIt was plugged in when we went to pick it up, I then saw that it was 1995 and the freezer didn\u2019t seem very cold, I tried to google really quick about the possibility of fixing before we actually took it, and from my 30 second google, it seems possible.  I was pulled away then to help move it.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s in my garage now.  I had been planning on buying a new one, but I\u2019m happy to save the $20,000+ for a little while if I can eek out a little more life from this.  The refrigerant is r12, my quick google said that it can be replaced",

The property is in East Texas mainly with post oaks, black jack oaks, and hickories.  The very largest trees are up to 22\" diameter.\n\nWhile I haven't owned a chainsaw, I'm extremely handy, have a full garage, and do wood working.  And I grew up working on off-road motorcycles and know 2 strokes very well.  Maintenance will be easy for me.\n\nI was considering a battery chainsaw for trimming and small jobs; I have a number of DeWalt batteries.  But after having my driveway blocked last week by a large fallen tree I realize I probably need a gas saw to be able to chop up a tree if if fall on the drive or on the road.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m hoping someone here can help me troubleshoot a **RYOBI 18V ONE+ HP brushless leaf blower (model P21012VNM)** that recently stopped working properly.\n\n**What\u2019s happening:**\n\n* I have **two 18V Ryobi batteries**\n* Both batteries are **fully functional and hold a charge**\n* When I insert a battery, the blower turns on and runs normally for about **3\u20135 seconds**\n* Then it **cuts out completely / dies**\n* If I remove the battery and reinsert it, the blower will again run for **3\u20135 seconds** and then shut off\n* This happens every time with **both batteries**\n\nSo the issue does **not** appear to be battery-related.\n\n**Additional info:**\n\n* Unit is **outside of warranty**, and Ryobi will not assist\n* No obvious debris blockage in the tube\n* Trigger feels normal\n* Tool was working fine previously\n\nHas anyone experienced this before?  \nCould this be a **thermal cutoff, controller issue, motor problem, or internal safety switch**?\n\nI\u2019m comfortable opening it up if needed \u2014 just",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI ordered a Bosch Dry 2000 dehumidifier from Amazon and received it yesterday. I chose this model because I read in many places that it's supposed to be fairly quiet.\n\nHowever, after a few minutes of running, it starts making a quite loud buzzing noise. The manual says that the dehumidifier can be noisy if the filter is dirty or if it's placed on an uneven surface. But the device is brand new, the filter is clean, and it keeps buzzing no matter what surface I put it on. I even tried placing it on a piece of felt, but that didn't make any difference.\n\nSo I decided to ask here - maybe someone owns this model and can tell me if this sound is normal, or if I might have received a defective unit.\n\nIn the video, you can hear the moment when the buzzing starts.",
