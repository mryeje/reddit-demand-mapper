The pro rated prices are $92.36, $80.25, and $92.36. The battery prices are $179.05. \n\nFigure I\u2019ll keep most of it. Might return, or sell the 382 recip saw and find a deal on a 367 after exploring older posts on here. I had one 5ah battery and one tiny black battery (2ah?) before these. I could use something else.\n\nPurchased through Lowe\u2019s app, and immediately saw pro rated price on receipt and email.

I always use jet dry and the water coming from my hot water heater is 142 degrees.  I typically pre rinse dishes so nothing is going in with chunks of debris. \n\nDoes anyone have a guess as to what this might be? \n\nMy previous 800 started doing this toward the end of warranty and Bosh diagnosed it as a leaking Zeolite container (the chemical used in the \"crystal dry\" heater less drying system) and replace the machine under warranty. \n\n  \nThe replacement machine is about two years old and now starting to do the same thing.

I know, corded and bagged vacuums are the best, but currently I live in a small apartment (60 sq.meters), and I don't really have the place to store a big corded vacuum, but later when I move to a bigger place, I'll definitely get a Sebo.\n\nI was looking at some models, they are as follows: \nLG CordZero A9K-CORE3S (big pro: it comes with 2 batteries), \nSamsung Jet 85 (this has more attachments than the LG), \nDreame Z30\n\nAnyone has experience with these vacuums, or can anyone guide me in the right direction? My apartment has 2 or 3 carpets, so I'd appreciate if my new vacuum had good suction on carpet as well (and especially could deal with girlfriend-hair). Also would be nice if it had same or better suction power than my old Dyson V6. It is important for me, that I'd like to get a vacuum that can be disassembled and cleaned p",

Anyway, I've got a couple questions that I'm hoping yall can help with.\n\n1. I know Makita doesn't run a lot of deals/promos compared to other brands. HD's current bogo deals seem like a pretty good entry point for getting into the ecosystem, is this the only time of year they run deals like this or do they do them periodically? Ideally I think I'd wait until spring to switch but I wouldn't have to wait another year.\n\n2. Impact is one of my 2 most used tools so I'm dead set on getting ",

        "selftext": "Currently I'm using a Dyson V6, but I'm afraid it doesn't have too much time left. That's why I would like to get your opinion about buying a new cordless vacuum. I know, corded and bagged vacuums are the best, but currently I live in a small apartment (60 sq.meters), and I don't really have the place to store a big corded vacuum, but later when I move to a bigger place, I'll definitely get a Sebo.\n\nI was looking at some models, they are as follows: \nLG CordZero A9K-CORE3S (big pro: it comes with 2 batteries), \nSamsung Jet 85 (this has more attachments than the LG), \nDreame Z30\n\nAnyone has experience with these vacuums, or can anyone guide me in the right direction? My apartment has 2 or 3 carpets, so I'd appreciate if my new vacuum had good suction on carpet as well (and especially could deal with girlfriend-hair). Also would be nice if it had same or better suction power than my old Dyson V6. It is important for me, that I'd like to get a vacuum that can be disassembled and cleaned p",

We are now planning on moving in a few months and I had to finally address this issue.  \n\nAfter I started demoing the floor I discovered 9\u201d x 9\u201d (99% of the time) asbestos tile covered up by one of the previous owners. I stopped immediately quarantine the bathroom cleaned all my tools and started calling around to get a quote for asbestos abatement plus demo. The first quote I got was $3500 to demo the entire floor. So I figured I could buy all of the necessary, filtering, vacuums, respirators, etc. equipment for a well under $3500. Even if I threw all of this special asbestos equipment away when I was finished, I could still be happy knowing how much money I saved.  \n\nOnce I got all of these asbestos and subfloor removed down to the 45\u00b0 planks, I started removing all of the 45\u00b0 planks that were rotting and termite damaged. Like in other areas of the house many of the 45\u00b0 planks and Joyce were damaged by termites.  ",

He had recently refurbished the motor. It had a plastic accessory caddy that I removed. I have had zero issues with it in 15 years. No plastic parts that  shatter/crack like my Meile or Dyson (neither of which ever seemed to manufacturer replacement parts for anything older than a few years). Oh, and bags last 4x as long, too. My Melie would stop sucking anything up if the bag was even 1/2 full. \n\n My wife accidentally dropped this metal body Royal  it at the top of a flight of stairs and it tumbled all the way down. No breakage. Maybe a dent or a scratch. The Melie would have shattered on impact. \n\nI'm a telling you: for something as basic as a  vacuum cleaner, this is the way. \n\n",

Is that true? I\u2019m in the US for the record.\n\nThe additional tools I\u2019d be interested in will mainly just replace the corded versions I already own. I\u2019d be interested in the circular saw, larger leaf blower (already have the small), trim router, multi tool, sawzall, job light/flashlight, blue tooth radio, perhaps a hammer drill, definitely interested in others but the more specialized they get, the less likely I\u2019d assume they\u2019d be in a kit.\n\nMy drill and driver are like 15 years old so I figure now is the time to get a big combo kit.
