I'm looking for recent opinions on the LS 002g, XGT. 216mm.\n\nI've seen reports that the Makita LS002g cuts with deflection, or that the screw that tightens the bevel breaks, but these are old reports, and I don't know if they've been resolved.\n\nI also have doubts about the efficiency of dust extraction, with the side flexible hose, both with and without a vacuum cleaner.\n\nExperience regarding the actual battery life is welcome. The vast majority of the work involves cutting wood derivatives such as MDF or HDF, which can be as hard as hardwood.\n\nThe company I work for is investing in new miter saws. We have many brands, mainly DeWalt, but we're investing almost everything in Festool (which is truly high quality, no doubt about it). We already have the Kapex 60, but personally, I really like Makita, although I had a bad experience with a lower-end model recently. This would be the first tool of the 40v battery system.\nThanks",

I went cordless with all my saws and angle grinders. \n\nRight now Im looking for options for professional carving saw. As much as I would love to go cordless it's just way too expensive with brands like Stihl or Husqvarna with MSA 220 and 535i XP being my favorites. Motor saws are not an option due to noise.\n\nSo I figured I could go corded saws. As I don't have much experience with corded saws I came here looking for guidance. I would love to get two saws, one for blocking and one for finer work. I usually make smaller products, such as bowls and vases, getting into sculpting and making benches and such.\n\nExcuse my English, looking forward to your suggestions.\n\nThank You in advance!",

In hindsight, I should have gone with the battery Makita model I originally considered. Mainly the fact that you need to breathe the fumes irritates me, plus it\u2019s not that powerful.\n\n\t2.\tThe DUC306 has been more than powerful enough. In mixed use with the brushcutter, I only went through one set of 5Ah batteries, which surprised me.

But since adding the new tankless water heater, I now have an extra outlet and what looks to me to be a drain? Can I run a little hose from the dehumidifier into this?
