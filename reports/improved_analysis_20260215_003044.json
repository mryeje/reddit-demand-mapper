Ended up getting two drills, two impacts, 4 3ah batteries, 4 2ah batteries, 3 18v chargers, and a Sawzall for $100. Serial numbers and model numbers aren't scratched out at all and there were no initials on anything until I added mine.\n\nMy estimate is that the overall value is around $350-$500. Unfortunately the Sawzall is not working, made some adjustments and it sounded like it might be locked up and wanted to go but then after a few tries it started smoking a bit so if you have any tips on repairing it that would be great. All the batteries work (so far) although one of the 3ah batteries is labeled \"bad\" with tape and when I put it on the charger it shows a red dot, green never shows up, yet it still charged up and tur",

Upon closer inspection I saw that the finish was pretty garbage and it didn't look like the metal colored painted surfaces would last a minute. I sent that back. Getting a refund was a nightmare. Now I'm ready to try again. Looking for a basic model that heats quickly and accurately, nothing fancy but something that won't look like crap in no time. I recently bit the bullet on a Bosch fridge. That thing is crap and repair prices are outrageous so no Bosch (we've had manual ice trays in our ice maker for months because that POS stopped working). Thanks for suggestions",

It was a simple plug and play, took 10 minutes to figure out. Everything was pre wired and ready to slot in. It's beyond me with their thinking, they knew the 20v version was coming out. So why not offer WTC stock in the 60v and omit it in the 20v version. Pros are more likely to opt for the 60v version, and willingly pay to have the feature. Likely wouldn't have cost me the extra C$110 I had to pay to get it shipped over here. Even then, I would have been fine paying for it.\n\nWith how simple this was, I'm tempted to see what else I can throw it in. I do use my little 7 1/4 Miter Saw for small trim jobs and would be real nice to have on there. I doubt it would be as simple as plug and play but I'm sure I could handle splicing 3 wires in. \n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if Dewalt took dust collection more serious in NA, even their cordless ",

Some videos are from small creators and some are big creators like Melissa from Clean My Space, Brandon from Clean That Up, Vacuum Wars, and Project Farm.\n\nNone of these videos ever mention Miele.

Now I'm ready to try again. Looking for a basic model that heats quickly and accurately, nothing fancy but something that won't look like crap in no time. I recently bit the bullet on a Bosch fridge. That thing is crap and repair prices are outrageous so no Bosch (we've had manual ice trays in our ice maker for months because that POS stopped working). Thanks for suggestions",

        "selftext": "This is how I heard about Miele the first time: back in 2017, I came across the [vacuum repair guy AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7gmsoe/iama_reddits_own_vacuum_repair_tech_with_a_very/) where I learned about how fantastic Miele is and how important it is to buy a bagged corded vacuum. I read OP's comments, explanations, and answers and I believed everything he was saying about vacuums. Keep in mind, this was back in 2017 when astroturfing/guerrilla marketing and bots wasn't a huge issue on Reddit.\n\nFast forward to now where recently I've been watching a lot of the most viewed YouTube videos on the topic of vacuuming. Not just vacuum product reviews but vacuuming in general.  Some videos are from small creators and some are big creators like Melissa from Clean My Space, Brandon from Clean That Up, Vacuum Wars, and Project Farm.\n\nNone of these videos ever mention Miele. Dyson is easily the most popular vacuum brand on YouTube. Some of these videos go back to 10+ years, way ",

When I opened it it had both a charger and 4ah battery in the box. there was a previous deal for this vacuum with a battery but it seems like they loaded the vacuum into the wrong box or something. has this happened to anyone else?",

They even rent my 12 inch corded saw , cordless chainsaws etc . This made me angry at first. Especially when I had to settle & buy a 1&9/16\u201d sds max Milwaukee roto hammer only to walk into the rental section to see the better makita version for rent . I\u2019ve realized that we can use this as an opportunity to see the makita products in person & then order them online . My local Home Depot\u2019s don\u2019t rent any Milwaukee or dewalt only makita . Home Depot buys makita products to rent because they last longer . They sell the other stuff because they make more $ selling products that need to be replaced more often. Check the rental section next time you\u2019re at Home Depot. That\u2019s where they keep the good stuff .",

Decided to add the 36v track saw to the roster. I think I\u2019ll get more use out the track saw than sinking money into a marginally better job-site table saw than the Hitachi I have now. I don\u2019t have the space or need for a heavy-duty cabinet saw. \n\nRecently bought 36v Makita blower kit on clearance at HD. And still use a 19 year old 14\u201d Makita 2-cycle concrete saw & corded grinder & 1 1/8 hammer drill, so I guess I\u2019m a Makita guy after all.",

I have the track saw and the sub compact recip saw in 18v. I have the string trimmer, 24in hedge trimmer, and circular saw in 40v. Looks like I can get the gt200d for $469 with an extra 2.5ah battery or I can get the xt297t for 349 with no extras. Is the performance that much greater in the 40v to justify the price difference? Also to note I already have an M12 drill and driver that I use for smaller tasks so this set would be mostly for heavy duty applications. ",
