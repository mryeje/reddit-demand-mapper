There is also an 18v version.\n\nOn an unrelated topic (xD) I\u2019ve wanted to get some nice cordless tools for a while (hammer drill, impact driver, reciprocating multitool, and some fun stuff like a flashlight and USB charger).\n\nSince I\u2019ve had DeWalt corded tools in the past, I kind of always thought I\u2019d go with them (\u201cone of these days\u201d), but since Makita seems to be the only company that sells an upright vacuum in the entire honking Philippines, it seemed like a perfect excuse.\n\nBut how often would I use the heavy vacuum battery on a tool, or the low-capacity tool batteries in the vacuum?

I have flex volt tools and batteries so it is reasonable to buy flexvolt saw. But\u2026\nIt seems to me people really opinionated about this particular saw even among those who like dewalt tools in general. I\u2019ve watched maybe a dozen of videos and I\u2019ve read reviews. Generally it\u2019s \u201cmixed reviews\u201d to say the least. \n\nAs far as I understand main problems are:\n1. **Bad tracks.** But it can run on festool track so I don\u2019t understand why even bother. I can buy festool tracks even cheaper than dewalt ones. So no issues here\n2. **Weird plunge mechanism.** I didn\u2019t try it in person but it looks alright to me. Yeah it\u2019s obviously different from other saws but I sure can live with it. And this is my first track saw ever, so I don\u2019t even need to get used to it really\n3. **Cumbersome blade change.** Many people complain that blade changing on the Dewalt is a major pain.

We\u2019re finding the dryer is consistently not drying on the automode and we are constantly having to run for a flat 90 minutes (wastes electricity and time). Also my wife is annoyed to always have to lean over (dryer only) and has already had surgery on back. FYI had the dryer venting tubing replaced last year when we bought the house because it was not up to code. \n\nMy understanding is that any washer / dryer we buy today will save on utility bills. Who knows how much.\n\nWould you recommend just buying a new dryer? Or buying a washing machine while we\u2019re at it to hopefully save some money on delivery/installation? (Laundry is downstairs in utility and we don\u2019t have immediate plans to move upstairs to second floor\u2026would probably be major construction\u2026all this to say is we have decent space now).

        "selftext": "Hi I just upgraded to my first gas chainsaw (Stihl ms291) after operating a battery powered one for years. Two days ago I tried to start it up for the first time and I flooded it pretty bad. I turned it upside down with the spark plug out and pulled the cord with the throttle engaged while on run. Gas wasn\u2019t dripping out but there was definitely some fuel vapour. I was able to clear it out and it eventually came to life. Idled it for a bit and cut down some trees to help clear out excess fuel. Ran okay and started it up normally that day. \n\nToday I went to start it pulled it on full choke twice (didn\u2019t hear burp but I read that the burp is sometimes hard to catch when the saw is brand new) then went half clutch, heard it catch but the catch was like full speed ahead. It sounded like I was going full throttle. I pressed the gas and then it died. Tried again in the run position and it started and it seemed to run very high idle again, as soon as I pressed the throttle it died. \n\nI remove",

        "selftext": "What is the difference between these two blades? Would the teeth help or hinder the ability to lift grass into the blade for cutting?\n\nI find my Ryobi mower pushes the grass down, leading to very uneven cuts. I am willing to try a different blade that is not designed for my model number to see if I get better performance. These blades match the hole pattern on my mower. I am okay with reduced battery performance if it results in better cutting performance. I need a mower blade that lifts the grass blades (and leaves) into the blade where they can be cut rather than pushing them into the ground as the mower passes over.\n\n  \nHome Depot product pages:\n\n[https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-20-in-Replacement-Blade-for-20-in-ONE-18-Volt-HP-Brushless-Whisper-Series-20-in-Lawn-Mower-AC04030/323114193](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-20-in-Replacement-Blade-for-20-in-ONE-18-Volt-HP-Brushless-Whisper-Series-20-in-Lawn-Mower-AC04030/323114193)\n\n[https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-20-in-Replacement",

The reason was that the compressors weren\u2019t pumping refrigerant around the system. Fast forward to this week, I replaced the tandem compressors, contactors, and filter drier.  Pressure tested, and pulled a vacuum after. When I go to turn on the unit, the compressors still isn\u2019t pumping refrigerant. The pressures are from the unit is on. What am I overlooking?",
