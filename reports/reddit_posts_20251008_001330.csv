I’m planning to drill a hole through my house exterior to run an Ethernet cable from inside to outside (for a PoE camera). I want to make sure I do it right the first time so I don’t deal with water leaks, drafts, or pests later.

What’s the best way to seal the hole around the cable on the exterior? (Silicone caulk, spray foam, cable gland, etc.?)

Should I use a rubber grommet or wall plate where the cable passes through?

AskEngineers,what kind of motor would be the best to add fake recoil to a laser tag gun?,"I want to put a motor holding a cylindrical weight inside a laser tag gun so when i accelerate the motor, itll tilt the gun upwards. But I don't know what kind of motor would work best. 

It needs: 

to have a relatively good amount of torque since the weight will be 200-300 grams. 

it needs to be able to **start spinning and stop spinning in 50ms** total (just under the fire rate of the fastest gun) (this is the most important thing)

the higher acceleration within that 50ms the better, cus st",27,25,1759855105.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1o0jumk/what_kind_of_motor_would_be_the_best_to_add_fake/,https://reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1o0jumk/what_kind_of_motor_would_be_the_best_to_add_fake/,"['expensive', ""don't know""]",['torque']

My understanding is that one of the limitations to the practicality/usability of the tilt rotor design seems to come from its large size, especially the rotor blades.",17,13,1759292370.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nuynw8/is_it_possible_practical_to_make_aircraft_like/,https://reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1nuynw8/is_it_possible_practical_to_make_aircraft_like/,[],['blade']

I’m installing a Regalraum “on-wall”, mounted shelving system in my Paris flat (old Haussmann building, internal wall is \~30mm plaster over hollow clay brick). The uprights are 2m (+30cm separate piece) tall with 10 screw holes each, and the shelves will hold a LOT of vinyl records (so think **300+ kg total potential load** spread across 4 uprights).
