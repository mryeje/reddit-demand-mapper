It's been fine since we've moved in and despite the odd flickering of lights when we turn on our garbage disposal or a hair dryer I'm of the mindset that if it hasn't already burned down in 80 years it's not a 'priority upgrade'. It's really more of a convenience concern; we have a modern panel with AFCI breakers so the people who flipped our house at least did the bare minimum to improve things. \n\nHaving said that, I would like to do some work on it and start bringing it up to modern standards. I've already swapped the few remaining ungrounded 2-prong outlets in our attic room to GFCI 3-prong ones, and I'd also like to run modern grounded wiring to our smaller first floor bedrooms that currently only have one outlet each, mainly so I can split our load more evenly across the panel, in case we want to plug in space heaters etc. \n\nI'm pretty confident that if I pull permits and follow the NEC and guides online I can do new h",

I also really liked the form factor with the small case, which easily fits in a normal backpack. \n\nHowever, after learning about the previous models I noticed the build quality on this one seems quite lower. \n\nI am unsure if I should take it back and spend just a hair more for the 484 and non basic batteries, which seems better built. I\u2019m also skeptical if they really managed to put a stronger motor on this new one that will last a long time. \n\nNot in the trades but I do tackle some nice projects from time to time. I am currently renovating my future record and audio store. ",

Here is an example on the wood on the unfinished side:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/zw0BWr2](https://imgur.com/a/zw0BWr2)\n\n  \nWhen you go into our basement, there are mold spots on some of the walls, door frames, and the wooden joist and floor boards visible on the unfinished side.  We got someone to do a mold remediation, but we were very unsatisfied with the amount of visible mold and several rooms/areas that appeared untouched.\n\nSo I bought a ton of RMR 86, and RMR 141 and went to work.  The RMR 86 made everything look beautiful again.  The RMR 141 killed the mold spores with a vengence.  I have been cleaning and killing mold for a couple of weeks now.  Things look great!  I also bought a couple dehumidifiers to get our humidity numbers down (Originall they were in the low 60's to low 70's sometimes...\n\nAnywa",

        "selftext": "I own a spa pool. I drain it about 3-4 times per year to change the water with a really good drain pump and give it a good thorough cleaning. \n\nBut the drain pump cannot reach 100% of the water, so there's always a few puddles with quite a few liters of water left which I have to scoop up with a bucket and a mop. Really annoying and quite cumbersome to be honest. So I was thinking of getting a vaccum cleaner which - at least on paper - also can suck up water, like this one:\n\nhttps://www.husqvarna.com/us/vacuum-cleaners/wdc225/\n\nMy question is simple yet perhaps stupid. But can I just like lower the nozzle into the water puddles and it works? What about the filter in the vacuum cleaner, for example?",

Later, when the need arises, I will definitely also buy an angle grinder, jigsaw, leaf blower, multitool and probably some other tools as well.\n\n2.0Ah battery and a charger will be included in the with the grass trimmer. I plan to also buy a 5.0Ah battery, but since I am buying via [amazon.de](http://amazon.de) and they don't ship batteries to my country, I will buy it seperatly.\n\nBefore I buy I would love to get your input on the order. Could I get this somewhere else cheaper or maybe a tool set would make more sense?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smh866smz91g1.png?width=2128&format=png&auto=webp&s=813934aba6061636113f37f46bfde73125e43209\n\n",

Just 6,9, 12 ah felxvolt batteries.  The batteries pictured with the blower are actually 12 ah...\n\nThen while looking for some battery deals, I find \"Free Good Included\" as a tag.  I assume this is a typo and they meant Tool...but it's on every single item with that sale.\n\nOther batteries seem to be mislabeled as well.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone!\nI am a homeowner that is (potentially) looking for a new chainsaw. I have almost a half acre of woods on my property and do a lot of pruning and clean up every year. Every few years I take down a 60ft tree with my brother in law.\nMy wife is looking to get me a Christmas gift and she suggested a new saw. I currently have an inherited Dolmar PS-540 that runs a little rough but I\u2019m confident given some time I can get it running on top shape.\nMy question is: rather than replace the Dolmar with a Stihl 271 (or similar) is it a better idea to get a smaller saw? I went to a few dealers and the form factor of the Echo 355t as well as the Stihl 194 and 201 seemed great.\nOr is there another option / size that might be a good idea?",
