It's not the batteries as I can use those on my other tools (String Trimmer and Leaf Blower) without issue.\n\nI finally contacted support this weekend.

They've told me that they need to assess it to determine if it's within the warranty terms and conditions.  This is just piss poor execution on their part.  I'm certain that I'll have to pay for the repair shop (it's not owned by Ryobi - it's a third party shop) only for them to tell me that it's not within warranty.

But LG models seem to have newer features like QuadWash, better Wi-Fi integration, and sometimes a lower price for similar specs.\n\nIf you\u2019ve used both brands, could you share your experience on:\n\t\u2022\tReliability (any service calls or breakdowns?)\n\t\u2022\tDrying performance (especially for plastics)\n\t\u2022\tNoise levels\n\t\u2022\tEase of maintenance or cleaning filters\n\t\u2022\tAny regrets or strong recommendations?\n\nTrying to figure out if Bosch is still worth the premium or if LG has caught up in 2025.\n\nThanks in advance \u2014 all real-world experiences appreciated!",

I would have to separate the washing machine load into two, the jeans and the lighter stuff.  And all in all, with both loads, talking about 4 hours.  And it would be \"dry\" and stop, then I'd have to keep adding time.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to get a vented unit to replace it.  But the only options were GE, and Samsung.  I am a bit leery of Samsung appliances.  And GE's reviews were good, but something made me hold back.\n\nSo I ended up with a Miele set.  And I've heard all sorts of bad reviews about how my clothes were going to be wet, etc.\n\nThe washing machine spins at 1600 so a lot of stuff comes out relatively dry feeling compared to the Blomberg but still in need of drying.\n\nI got the cheapest T1, with the solid white door.\n\nIt's a louder unit than I thought it was going to be.

        "selftext": "I'm fairly frustrated.  I purchased this edger on 4/25/25 from Home Depot.  Worked great for several months but then suddenly lost 90% of its power about a month ago.  It will rotate but at a very low RPM and not enough to be effective.  It's not the batteries as I can use those on my other tools (String Trimmer and Leaf Blower) without issue.\n\nI finally contacted support this weekend.  They've provided me with two repair locations... one of which is about 2 hours away and another of which is roughly 45 minutes drive from my house.  \n\nI informed them that I do not expect to pay for the repair since the device is less than 6 months old.  They've told me that they need to assess it to determine if it's within the warranty terms and conditions.  This is just piss poor execution on their part.  I'm certain that I'll have to pay for the repair shop (it's not owned by Ryobi - it's a third party shop) only for them to tell me that it's not within warranty.  I've asked for more clarity as to t",

After months of comparing Luba 2, Segway Navimow, and Anthbot Genie, I finally went with the Genie 3000 - mainly because I was done repairing broken boundary wires on my old Worx.\n\n\n\nSetup & Build\n\nSetup was way easier than I expected. The box comes with the mower, dock, RTK \u201cmushroom\u201d antenna, cables, extra blades, tools, and an actually useful quick-start guide (rare).\n\n All I did was:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug in the dock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount the RTK antenna somewhere with a clear sky view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPair via Bluetooth in the app\n\n\n\n\n\nFirmware took \\~15 min to update (needed solid Wi-Fi for that), but after that, it\u2019s been fine even at the far end of my backyard.
