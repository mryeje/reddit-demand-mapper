Over a period of about a week it was not washing dishes well, had intermittent leaking from the bottom front door area and from what I could tell, the bottom spray arm was spinning correctly. Original post is here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/appliancerepair/s/rxGAjdKqmk \n\nI’ve gotten a chance to get a gopro in there and get a better idea of what’s going on. I’ve attached a video from a part of the cycle. Hoping it can help narrow down the issue. Couple things I noticed:\n\n- the lower bar doesn’t spin often despite water being directed to it\n- not all nozzles on the lower bar spray water out from them\n- there seems to be substantial water coming from the side of the spray arm on both sides\n\nSeems to me like the issue is with the spray arm but is this normal for whirlpool dishwashers? Any suggestions to fixing it. ",

Wouldn't close and even if forced to close, wouldn't latch. She said oh this'll be easy. I just wanted advice, but ten minutes later, the door was working perfectly. \n\nI thanked her for the help and for teaching me some new tricks. She said no problem and that she learned new things too. I asked what she could've possibly learned. She said well mainly that Ryobi tools don't suck. She was impressed that the drills and angle grinder we ended up needing performed just as well as her yellow tools. \n\nLater when my wife thanked her for the help with the door, she said she doesn't mind doing fixes like that at our place because \"I don't have to",

Its the same color I used to paint all my RC cars in and I have always been a fan of the Lotus Isotope Green color.\n\nI am now back to working as a mechanic and have continued to grow the Ryobi collection.\n\nNow, my opinions.\n\nWork Power Tools: I use the impact driver still daily at work, but have found the Milwaukee M18 series 3/8\" and 1/2\" impacts to be far superior for those roles. So all heavy work is done by the Milwaukees, but anything that involves taking interiors apart...Ryobi. I also use the large portable fans during the summer as they come in handy since I work outside.\n\nRyobi Link: I have the rolling tool box, small box, 2 drawer box, 2 6-bin organizers, and the crate. I use these every night at work and they have NEVER Skipped a beat. I just wish Ryobi would make more accessories for the system like Milwaukee, Rigid, etc. to make organization easier.\n\nAt Home: ",

I plan to pick up some small projects, but I also like buying tools with versatility in mind so I may handle small jobs/repairs on my own. \n\nFor background, the tools I currently own come from a secondhand marketplace purchase with a drill, impact, flashlights, and a tire inflator.

I have murdered my DCD991 cordless drill.  \n\nIt has worked so well up until now.  No, not the drill (but also yes, the drill) but rather my abhorrent deployment of this beautiful tools torque.  Sure, I drive screws, ledgerloks, and bolts like any shadetree mechanic or homeowner, and for this she has served me well.  I built a shed with this tool.  I planted 100 daffodil bulbs with this tool.  But it was my use (abuse?) of this tool as a starter motor that stove her in.\n\nYou see, as any good God fearing exurban American, I have a fine collection of small 4 stroke gasoline engines with recoil pull starts.  A pressure washer, a log splitter, a chipper shredder, a generator.  And as each pull start cord frayed and snapped on each piece of equipment, I removed the recoil start, shouted to the sky \"fuck this noise\" and found the correct socket to use my trusty DCD991 to turn over the engine.\n\n",

I already own a 7 1/4” LXT circular saw.  My original plan was to get the classic 10” LS1040 for its simplicity and lightweight portability.  Its size allows me to carry it out of the basement where I keep my tools to use on some sawhorses in the driveway or the backyard and use the 7 1/4” circular saw for the wider cuts that the miter saw can’t handle.\n\nHowever I’m a “buy once cry once” kind of guy and I know eventually I will want to upgrade from the LS1040 down the road.  The LS1019L doesn’t seem to be a realistic",

Wouldn't close and even if forced to close, wouldn't latch. She said oh this'll be easy. I just wanted advice, but ten minutes later, the door was working perfectly. \n\nI thanked her for the help and for teaching me some new tricks. She said no problem and that she learned new things too. I asked what she could've possibly learned. She said well mainly that Ryobi tools don't suck. She was impressed that the drills and angle grinder we ended up needing performed just as well as her yellow tools. \n\nLater when my wife thanked her for the help with the door, she said she doesn't mind doing fixes like that at our place because \"I don't have to",

I plan to pick up some small projects, but I also like buying tools with versatility in mind so I may handle small jobs/repairs on my own. \n\nFor background, the tools I currently own come from a secondhand marketplace purchase with a drill, impact, flashlights, and a tire inflator. This morning I bought the 4 1/2” circular saw. Now I plan to get two batteries plus a free tool, what do you feel best rounds out my tool selection? \nAlso, are there any you’d recommend I wait specifically to buy it brushless?\n\n",

Its the same color I used to paint all my RC cars in and I have always been a fan of the Lotus Isotope Green color.\n\nI am now back to working as a mechanic and have continued to grow the Ryobi collection.\n\nNow, my opinions.\n\nWork Power Tools: I use the impact driver still daily at work, but have found the Milwaukee M18 series 3/8\" and 1/2\" impacts to be far superior for those roles. So all heavy work is done by the Milwaukees, but anything that involves taking interiors apart...Ryobi. I also use the large portable fans during the summer as they come in handy since I work outside.\n\nRyobi Link: I have the rolling tool box, small box, 2 drawer box, 2 6-bin organizers, and the crate. I use these every night at work and they have NEVER Skipped a beat. I just wish Ryobi would make more accessories for the system like Milwaukee, Rigid, etc. to make organization easier.\n\nAt Home: ",

Where I've heard conflicting information is whether 4ah is sufficient for Max setting usage, or if there is any benefit to using high performance 4ah batteries. I don't really understand how the HP batteries work. Will a device without the HP extra wire be able to take advantage of its higher current draw capabilities? Will the battery degrade less under the Max setting than a regular 4ah battery? Or should I just save the money and buy a regular 4ah battery?",
