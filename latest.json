The case was escalated to engineering and product quality, and GE has now offered either:\n\n\t•\tA no‑charge replacement (delivery, installation, removal included), or\n\n\t•\tA cash buyout equal to the purchase price of the unit (not including install or tax)\n\nI initially planned to stay with GE for simplicity, but after researching replacement options, I’m concerned this may be a platform‑level issue.\n\nI reviewed higher‑end GE Profile models, including PDT795SYVFS, and I’m seeing reports of the same spray arm melting issue.

In my forest, there is mostly black locust,  thickness is around 25-35 cm or 10\"-14\", sometimes little bit bigger.   \n  \nCurrently i use a Makita UC4051 for cutting firewood, it is 6 or 7 years old and works perfectly fine, but i cannot use that in my forest. I will still use this for cutting wood, because light, cheap, mostly maintanance free option.  \n  \nIm currently cannot choose between the likes of  Oleo Mac GS630 / Stihl MS261 / Husqvarna 550xp vs the much cheaper not professional versions, like the Oleo GS560, Stihl MS231 etc..\n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\n",

I usually need 8-10 m3 firewood/year and i need a petrol chainsaw for that.  In my forest, there is mostly black locust,  thickness is around 25-35 cm or 10\"-14\", sometimes little bit bigger.   \n  \nCurrently i use a Makita UC4051 for cutting firewood, it is 6 or 7 years old and works perfectly fine, but i cannot use that in my forest. I will still use this for cutting wood, because light, cheap, mostly maintanance free option.  \n  \nIm currently cannot choose between the likes of  Oleo Mac GS630 / Stihl MS261 / Husqvarna 550xp vs the much cheaper not professional versions, like the Oleo GS560, Stihl MS231 etc..\n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\n",

However, right fresh drawer can be opened just with right door.\n\nFridge - how do I tell the current temp of the fridge? I tried both in fridge and app and it’s not very straightforward. Old fridge had current and set so easy to tell. Online searches don’t seem to work pressing the buttons.\n\nFridge - the secondary fan that turns on and off is quite loud. Not sure if normal.\n\nFridge - right door takes more push to close than it should. Push it to close and it stops before full close since it needs that extra hook.\n\nFreezer - ice tray is huge. Also didn’t get a scoop. I do like the shape though compared to the old half moons.\n\nDishwasher - can’t set time delay without using the app. My old one I could just set on device. I don’t want to have to use the app.\n\nDishwasher - controls just don’t feel that responsive or clear. ",

I’m looking for a few local people (Raleigh-Durham NC) who would be interested in testing it out for about a month or two and then filling out a short feedback survey.\n\nThis is not a sales pitch — no strings attached; I just need real-world testers to get input before I move into the next round of development.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n* You use your shop vac on a regular / near-daily basis\n* Ideally you’re already using a higher-end vacuum (Festool, Fein, Makita, Milwaukee, etc.) or at least care about things like:\n   * HEPA filtration\n   * auto tool start / power tool activation\n   * fine dust performance\n* You’re willing to actually use the vac in your normal workflow and provide honest feedback.\n\nIf you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me and I’ll follow up with details.\n\nThanks!",

Now three weeks later there’s this persistent musty smell that won’t go away no matter how much I air it out.\n\nI grabbed a basic dehumidifier from the hardware store and it’s pulling water like crazy, tank fills up twice a day. But the smell is still there, especially near the drywall in the back corner.\n\nMy concern is mold growing inside the walls where I can’t see it. The drywall doesn’t look damaged from the outside but I know water wicks up and sits in there. Do I need to cut out the bottom two feet and replace it or is that overkill?\n\nMy wife wants to get one of those fancy air and purifier systems installed but I feel like that’s just masking the problem if there’s actual mold behind the walls. We need to fix the source first.\n\nI’ve been comparing dehumidifier specs and even checked wholesale pricing on alibaba just to understand wh",

Old fridge had current and set so easy to tell. Online searches don’t seem to work pressing the buttons.\n\nFridge - the secondary fan that turns on and off is quite loud. Not sure if normal.\n\nFridge - right door takes more push to close than it should. Push it to close and it stops before full close since it needs that extra hook.\n\nFreezer - ice tray is huge. Also didn’t get a scoop. I do like the shape though compared to the old half moons.\n\nDishwasher - can’t set time delay without using the app. My old one I could just set on device. I don’t want to have to use the app.\n\nDishwasher - controls just don’t feel that responsive or clear. ",

I usually need 8-10 m3 firewood/year and i need a petrol chainsaw for that.  In my forest, there is mostly black locust,  thickness is around 25-35 cm or 10\"-14\", sometimes little bit bigger.   \n  \nCurrently i use a Makita UC4051 for cutting firewood, it is 6 or 7 years old and works perfectly fine, but i cannot use that in my forest. I will still use this for cutting wood, because light, cheap, mostly maintanance free option.  \n  \nIm currently cannot choose between the likes of  Oleo Mac GS630 / Stihl MS261 / Husqvarna 550xp vs the much cheaper not professional versions, like the Oleo GS560, Stihl MS231 etc..\n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\n",
