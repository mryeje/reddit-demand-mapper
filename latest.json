I just cant shake the feeling that 500w just isnt enough, but at the same time know there is no standard for what numbers manufacturer's can throw on the box.\n\nWhich would be the better option?  Or are there other electric options i should be looking at?\nIt feels very much comparing an entry level of a commercial brand against the top of the line of a consumer brand. \n\nLong term, id also be getting a hedge trimmer, articulating hedge trimmer, wipper snipper and a leaf blower. So the quality of the whole eco system would also be super important.\n\nThanks!!",

I've read about the auger failing to engage or the unit stalling out in very cold conditions, which some users attributed to the electronics/control board or the batteries getting too cold.\n2. **Chute Control Issues:** I've seen mentions of the chute directional control being too loose or too tight, making it difficult to aim or causing it to swing wildly when hitting heavy snow.\n3. **Storage:** My snow blower would be stored in an unheated shed outside. I know Ryobi recommends storing the batteries indoors at room temperature, but ",

I've read about the auger failing to engage or the unit stalling out in very cold conditions, which some users attributed to the electronics/control board or the batteries getting too cold.\n2. **Chute Control Issues:** I've seen mentions of the chute directional control being too loose or too tight, making it difficult to aim or causing it to swing wildly when hitting heavy snow.\n3. **Storage:** My snow blower would be stored in an unheated shed outside. I know Ryobi recommends storing the batteries indoors at room temperature, but ",

Despite having an extensive hand-tool setup, I’ve always relied on shared-shop power tools (because… I’m cheap, and don’t want to use my stuff for someone else I’m working for). I’m currently in a shared shop (working for myself) with all the machines I need, but I finally need to buy my own cordless drill (an impact would be nice, though not strictly necessary).\n\nI’m also considering picking up a corded trim router (I don’t love how top-heavy the cordless versions feel) and a Makita track saw. I’ll be traveling to Japan in January, so I could buy tools there. The alternate colorways are fun but I suspect the holiday combo-kit deals here in the US might be a better value.\n\nSo:Does anyone have advice on which Makita tools or kits make the most sense, and any specific holiday sales (Home Depot, etc.) worth watching? My essentials are a cordless drill, w",

        "selftext": "Not a big renovation question, but hoping this fits here since it's about home maintenance.\n\nI live in a small apartment (about 500 sq ft) with a long-haired cat, and the fur situation is getting out of hand. I’m sweeping constantly and still finding little tumbleweeds everywhere. My current vacuum is bulky, loud, and takes up half my coat closet, so every time I use it, it feels like a whole operation, unwinding the cord, dragging it around, and then struggling to store it again afterward.\n\nI’ve been thinking about switching to a cordless vacuum because the idea of grabbing something light and quick sounds perfect for a small space with a shedding pet. But I’m still unsure if they’re actually strong enough for real daily cleaning or if they clog easily with long hair. For anyone who’s made the switch, I’d love to know how the suction and battery hold up in real use, and whether you felt the price you paid was worth it. I’m also curious what price range people usually buy theirs at, an",

I just cant shake the feeling that 500w just isnt enough, but at the same time know there is no standard for what numbers manufacturer's can throw on the box.\n\nWhich would be the better option?  Or are there other electric options i should be looking at?\nIt feels very much comparing an entry level of a commercial brand against the top of the line of a consumer brand. \n\nLong term, id also be getting a hedge trimmer, articulating hedge trimmer, wipper snipper and a leaf blower. So the quality of the whole eco system would also be super important.\n\nThanks!!",

I've read about the auger failing to engage or the unit stalling out in very cold conditions, which some users attributed to the electronics/control board or the batteries getting too cold.\n2. **Chute Control Issues:** I've seen mentions of the chute directional control being too loose or too tight, making it difficult to aim or causing it to swing wildly when hitting heavy snow.\n3. **Storage:** My snow blower would be stored in an unheated shed outside. I know Ryobi recommends storing the batteries indoors at room temperature, but ",

The current string trimmer is a 40v B&D, but it doesn't seem that great.  I've been looking at the LTX 36v power heads to replace it and add the pole hedger and edger.  I've also been looking for a small chainsaw for stuff around the house and camping/off-roading.  We don't have a big yard my any means, maybe 500 square feet of pavers and grass and the string trimmer is used to get up against the fence.  Will the 18v deal here feel like a downgrade in power from the 40v B&D, or should I just go with the 36v and forego the free chainsaw kit?  OR would Makita honor the chainsaw kit if I bought a 36v power head kit?",
