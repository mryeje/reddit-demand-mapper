I wouldn't want it to be my only circular saw, but I also can see myself grabbing it first quite often. Time will tell whether it holds up, of course. If they make a brushless version, I'd probably buy it too when a good deal comes along.\n\n# Build Quality & First Impressions\n\nThe saw’s build quality is solid for its size and price. Nothing feels flimsy, the guard tracks smoothly, and the base plate sits square.\n\nThe standout attribute for me was that it’s **extremely lightweight.**\n\nThis is the kind of saw you can grab with one hand and comfortably make controlled cuts with.\n\n# Cutting Performance\n\nI tested it on a standard 2x4 stud, which are actually 1.5\" thick - just within the capacity of the saw's 1 9/16\" cut capacity (which is not a coincidence).\n\nMy experience:\n\n* cut smoothly\n* stayed stable in the cut\n* didn’t bog down under no",

But nothing to make me worried about water damage. It died after a while so I thought I ran out of power. So I stopped and the next day threw it on the charger and it said it was charging. About 2 weeks later I tried to use the battery and it was broken. \n\nAnd now the battery won’t charge. It flashes the lights when I check the level and the charger stays on error. \n\nMy friend only uses dewalt and he says he’s left them in the rain and nothing happened to them. \n\nSo ryobi batteries have poor water and dust sealing? Considering switching from ryobi if this is true. \n\nOr Is this only an issue with lithium batteries having more components inside?",

I wouldn't want it to be my only circular saw, but I also can see myself grabbing it first quite often. Time will tell whether it holds up, of course. If they make a brushless version, I'd probably buy it too when a good deal comes along.\n\n# Build Quality & First Impressions\n\nThe saw’s build quality is solid for its size and price. Nothing feels flimsy, the guard tracks smoothly, and the base plate sits square.\n\nThe standout attribute for me was that it’s **extremely lightweight.**\n\nThis is the kind of saw you can grab with one hand and comfortably make controlled cuts with.\n\n# Cutting Performance\n\nI tested it on a standard 2x4 stud, which are actually 1.5\" thick - just within the capacity of the saw's 1 9/16\" cut capacity (which is not a coincidence).\n\nMy experience:\n\n* cut smoothly\n* stayed stable in the cut\n* didn’t bog down under no",

I started looking for ways to automate the process while still keeping the Extra Dry and Sanitize options enabled.\n\nOne user suggested a Google Home automation, but it didn’t work for me. In my region (Canada), the only available actions are to turn the dishwasher on or off at a specific time; there’s no option to actually start a program.\n\nI also tried Alexa Routines, which *could* start a cycle on a schedule, but it always disabled the Extra Dry and Sanitize settings.\n\nThen I discovered IFTTT. Using the free tier, I created a simple trigger to start the Auto program every night at 1 a.m. I tested it, and it worked, plus it retained the Extra Dry and Sanitize options.\n\nAfter that, I disabled Permanent Remote Start on the dishwasher. Now, if I want a delayed start, all I have to do is press",

I replaced the shocks and cleaned out all filters and screens and am at a bit of a loss for what to do next. There is also a loud click coming from the top of the drum, but only during the spin cycle, which I believe means it only happens during reverse. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

But nothing to make me worried about water damage. It died after a while so I thought I ran out of power. So I stopped and the next day threw it on the charger and it said it was charging. About 2 weeks later I tried to use the battery and it was broken. \n\nAnd now the battery won’t charge. It flashes the lights when I check the level and the charger stays on error. \n\nMy friend only uses dewalt and he says he’s left them in the rain and nothing happened to them. \n\nSo ryobi batteries have poor water and dust sealing? Considering switching from ryobi if this is true. \n\nOr Is this only an issue with lithium batteries having more components inside?",

If they make a brushless version, I'd probably buy it too when a good deal comes along.\n\n# Build Quality & First Impressions\n\nThe saw’s build quality is solid for its size and price. Nothing feels flimsy, the guard tracks smoothly, and the base plate sits square.\n\nThe standout attribute for me was that it’s **extremely lightweight.**\n\nThis is the kind of saw you can grab with one hand and comfortably make controlled cuts with.\n\n# Cutting Performance\n\nI tested it on a standard 2x4 stud, which are actually 1.5\" thick - just within the capacity of the saw's 1 9/16\" cut capacity (which is not a coincidence).\n\nMy experience:\n\n* cut smoothly\n* stayed stable in the cut\n* didn’t bog down under no",

        "selftext": "hello, So I’ve been using a pretty old upright vacuum for years and honestly it’s such a pain dragging it around the house, especially up and down stairs. I’ve been thinking about switching to a cordless one because I like the idea of not having to deal with cords and being able to just grab it for a quick clean.\n\nHas anyone made the switch recently? I’m mainly looking for something that’s strong enough for carpets but still light enough to not feel like a workout every time I use it. Also curious about battery life how long does it usually last before needing a recharge?\n\nI’ve read mixed things about attachments too. Like, do you really need all those extra brushes or is it mostly overkill? And how noisy are these compared to old-school vacuums?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences. Any advice on what to watch out for before buying?",
