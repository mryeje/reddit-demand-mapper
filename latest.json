I’m impressed with the quality. Super heavy duty. My use-case just isn’t there. Having these tools in them actually makes them quite heavy and tough to access from that bottom shelf in my workbench. I’m just an average dude looking for nice tool storage at my home.\n\nWhat got me looking into these is that I didn’t have a case for that reciprocating saw nor the sander. The standard case that originally came with the drills is actually quite functional and way smaller and lighter. Of course not as heavy duty. At the price of these two boxes, $160, I could probably hunt down a brushless Makita saw with a case included somewhere. I do love that saw I already have though, it kicks ass. One of my most prized possessions.\n\nTo get everything loaded into these two boxes I had to take most of the organizers out of them. The organizer I ",

Last spring I jumped on the BOGO deal for the FlexVolt DCST972 kit with a free 9Ah battery from Home Depot for $329. It seemed like a no-brainer since I planned on getting the pole saw at some point in the future, and with a 2-pack of 9Ah batteries selling for $399 (or $349 on sale), I thought why not get a \"free\" string trimmer to go with it.

It was a ca. 2012/2013 Bosch 500 dishwasher, had a few parts that were going bad but I replaced them (looking at your rinse aid dispenser and pocket handle!).\n\nOur double wall ovens needed replacement, so we went with Bosch, and decided to tackle the dishwasher at the same time. We went with the Bosch Benchmark with a bar handle over the Miele G 7186, taking advantage of a bundle discount. The handle exactly matches the handles on the oven. \n\nNo complaints, wish we would have done this 3 years ago when our original fridge died and we replaced it with a Bosch 800 (the french door with separate bins for fruits and veggies, highly recommended). Our standard cycle is Auto w/Sanitize. That was 2:47 in our previous dishwasher. It is now 2:18 and the dishes come out cleaner and dryer, and not even using CrystalDry.

It was a ca. 2012/2013 Bosch 500 dishwasher, had a few parts that were going bad but I replaced them (looking at your rinse aid dispenser and pocket handle!).\n\nOur double wall ovens needed replacement, so we went with Bosch, and decided to tackle the dishwasher at the same time. We went with the Bosch Benchmark with a bar handle over the Miele G 7186, taking advantage of a bundle discount. The handle exactly matches the handles on the oven. \n\nNo complaints, wish we would have done this 3 years ago when our original fridge died and we replaced it with a Bosch 800 (the french door with separate bins for fruits and veggies, highly recommended). Our standard cycle is Auto w/Sanitize. That was 2:47 in our previous dishwasher. It is now 2:18 and the dishes come out cleaner and dryer, and not even using CrystalDry.

Wife really wants a quad door, and the options I see are some reasonably price Samsungs and LGs, and a much more expensive Frigidaire.\n\nWhen I google fridge advice, I see lots of posts from people saying to avoid Samsung and LG like the plague, and that the electronics and water systems tend to die within 2-3 years right when the warranty expires. A lot of that advice is from posts 2-5 years old.\n\nOf course I also find posts saying to avoid Frigidaires and GEs too… seems like every fridge brand has problems these days unless you go for the high end brands. Is there really that much difference between a Samsung/LG and a Frigidaire? Is there just more stuff in the former that can break which causes the unreliability perception? \n\nHas the advice to avoid LG and Samsung changed in recent years? Has their reliability improved, or does it just take a few years for people to",

It was a ca. 2012/2013 Bosch 500 dishwasher, had a few parts that were going bad but I replaced them (looking at your rinse aid dispenser and pocket handle!).\n\nOur double wall ovens needed replacement, so we went with Bosch, and decided to tackle the dishwasher at the same time. We went with the Bosch Benchmark with a bar handle over the Miele G 7186, taking advantage of a bundle discount. The handle exactly matches the handles on the oven. \n\nNo complaints, wish we would have done this 3 years ago when our original fridge died and we replaced it with a Bosch 800 (the french door with separate bins for fruits and veggies, highly recommended). Our standard cycle is Auto w/Sanitize. That was 2:47 in our previous dishwasher. It is now 2:18 and the dishes come out cleaner and dryer, and not even using CrystalDry.

I’m just an average dude looking for nice tool storage at my home.\n\nWhat got me looking into these is that I didn’t have a case for that reciprocating saw nor the sander. The standard case that originally came with the drills is actually quite functional and way smaller and lighter. Of course not as heavy duty. At the price of these two boxes, $160, I could probably hunt down a brushless Makita saw with a case included somewhere. I do love that saw I already have though, it kicks ass. One of my most prized possessions.\n\nTo get everything loaded into these two boxes I had to take most of the organizers out of them. The organizer I ",

Wife really wants a quad door, and the options I see are some reasonably price Samsungs and LGs, and a much more expensive Frigidaire.\n\nWhen I google fridge advice, I see lots of posts from people saying to avoid Samsung and LG like the plague, and that the electronics and water systems tend to die within 2-3 years right when the warranty expires. A lot of that advice is from posts 2-5 years old.\n\nOf course I also find posts saying to avoid Frigidaires and GEs too… seems like every fridge brand has problems these days unless you go for the high end brands. Is there really that much difference between a Samsung/LG and a Frigidaire? Is there just more stuff in the former that can break which causes the unreliability perception? \n\nHas the advice to avoid LG and Samsung changed in recent years? Has their reliability improved, or does it just take a few years for people to",
