I only needed something to make basic holes like pilot holes, attach fasteners etc.  I'm just trying to make sure I get something that will last long and I'll be happy with.  For basic DIY stuff I can totally get by with something much cheaper.   But I kind of wanted something nice anyway.\n\nAnyway each time I went to ask about Makita at the store I was told by the sales associates that Makita was not popular.  In fact they outright told me no one was buying Makita anymore and they are all buying this other brand.  And I should just choose other brand.  I didn't quite believe that because I know there are people that use Makita on YouTube and even the tool ",

The property is in East Texas mainly with post oaks, black jack oaks, and hickories.  The very largest trees are up to 22\" diameter.\n\nWhile I haven't owned a chainsaw, I'm extremely handy, have a full garage, and do wood working.  And I grew up working on off-road motorcycles and know 2 strokes very well.  Maintenance will be easy for me.\n\nI was considering a battery chainsaw for trimming and small jobs; I have a number of DeWalt batteries.  But after having my driveway blocked last week by a large fallen tree I realize I probably need a gas saw to be able to chop up a tree if if fall on the drive or on the road.

I bought a 10 acre property I spend most weekends at.  It's heavily treed and trees often fall down and need to be cut up and moved.  The property is in East Texas mainly with post oaks, black jack oaks, and hickories.  The very largest trees are up to 22\" diameter.\n\nWhile I haven't owned a chainsaw, I'm extremely handy, have a full garage, and do wood working.  And I grew up working on off-road motorcycles and know 2 strokes very well.  Maintenance will be easy for me.\n\nI was considering a battery chainsaw for trimming and small jobs; I have a number of DeWalt batteries.  But after having my driveway blocked last week by a large fallen tree I realize I probably need a gas saw to be able to chop up a tree if if fall on the drive or on the road.  That seems to happen 1-2 times per year.  Other than that, it will be mostly trimming a",

I only needed something to make basic holes like pilot holes, attach fasteners etc.  I'm just trying to make sure I get something that will last long and I'll be happy with.  For basic DIY stuff I can totally get by with something much cheaper.   But I kind of wanted something nice anyway.\n\nAnyway each time I went to ask about Makita at the store I was told by the sales associates that Makita was not popular.  In fact they outright told me no one was buying Makita anymore and they are all buying this other brand.  And I should just choose other brand.  I didn't quite believe that because I know there are people that use Makita on YouTube and even the tool ",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of “buy it for life” discussion around appliances, and it’s worth repeating: for most modern appliances, BIFL basically doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nOutside of a few exceptions like Sub-Zero and Speed Queen, most household appliances today are realistically designed for around 10 years, and many don’t even make it to five. A big part of the problem isn’t just build quality — it’s parts availability. With brands like LG and Samsung, many local parts suppliers have a very difficult time stocking Korean-made parts, which often leads to weeks-long delays. When it’s a refrigerator, washer, or range, most people can’t wait, so the appliance gets replaced instead of repaired.\n\nInterestingly, those same suppliers often don’t seem to have the same issues with European manufacturers, which raises some legitimate questions about how parts distribution is being handled.\n\nAnother thing buyers should be aware of: manufacturers are increasingly gaming reviews.\n\nA common tactic now is making ve",

The owners are doing a $1.2 million remodel and the contractors were the ones giving it away. They said it was working fine.  There was a lot of interest in it, so I could dilly dally on asking a lot of questions before committing to it. I live in a very affluent place so it’s not uncommon for people to give away things worth a lot of $$.\n\nIt was plugged in when we went to pick it up, I then saw that it was 1995 and the freezer didn’t seem very cold, I tried to google really quick about the possibility of fixing before we actually took it, and from my 30 second google, it seems possible.  I was pulled away then to help move it.\n\nAnyway, it’s in my garage now.  I had been planning on buying a new one, but I’m happy to save the $20,000+ for a little while if I can eek out a little more life from this.

When it’s a refrigerator, washer, or range, most people can’t wait, so the appliance gets replaced instead of repaired.\n\nInterestingly, those same suppliers often don’t seem to have the same issues with European manufacturers, which raises some legitimate questions about how parts distribution is being handled.\n\nAnother thing buyers should be aware of: manufacturers are increasingly gaming reviews.\n\nA common tactic now is making ve",

I chose this model because I read in many places that it's supposed to be fairly quiet.\n\nHowever, after a few minutes of running, it starts making a quite loud buzzing noise. The manual says that the dehumidifier can be noisy if the filter is dirty or if it's placed on an uneven surface. But the device is brand new, the filter is clean, and it keeps buzzing no matter what surface I put it on. I even tried placing it on a piece of felt, but that didn't make any difference.\n\nSo I decided to ask here - maybe someone owns this model and can tell me if this sound is normal, or if I might have received a defective unit.\n\nIn the video, you can hear the moment when the buzzing starts.",
