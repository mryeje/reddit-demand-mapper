I decided to get myself an impact driver of my own and while shopping saw there was a better deal on home depot. My original order was for a dewalt 2 amp hr and 5 amp combo pack with the charger and a free atomic impact wrench. When i went to get my own, I saw that I could have gotten the same package with an atomic impact driver and atomic hammer drill for $100 more, so I got that deal and I am going to swap out the original MAX impact driver for the atomic impact driver along with trading one of the 2amp hr batteries for the other 5amp hr battery.\n\n\n\nI will keep the MAX impact driver, the second atomic impact wrench, and 2 of the 3x 2amp hr batteries, and 2amp battery charger. I will be giving my dad the atomic impact driver, impact wrench, and hammer drill along with both 4amp battery chargers and the 2x 5amp hr and 1x 2amp hr batteries along with his other set up i mentioned in an earlier po",

Looking for a replacement ASAP. Family of 4 with two very young children and a large doodle. We need something robust that will get our clothes clean. I’ve heard good things about speed queen but the price is a little jarring.\n\nIs a speed queen worth it?\n\nWould you replace both at the same time so they match, or just do the washer for now?\n\nIf not speed queen, what do you recommend? We live in the suburbs of a decently sized city (Cleveland, OH) so I’m not too worried about parts availability or servicing. I don’t care at all about bells and whistles, I just want the thing to clean well and stand the test of time.\n\nThank you!",

It’s a simple old ranch that needs a lot of work and I have a bunch of time on my hands. So far here are the power tools I’ve bought and the lessons I’ve learned.\n\nOverpowered flex volt dewalt drill. Regret this. Yeah it’s powerful but anything past shoulder height or elbow and it’s much more of a work out than I signed up for.\n\nDewalt Atomic impact drill: love this thing.\n\nDewalt flex volt leafblower. It’s powerful but dies fast. Not a regret just because the 9ah battery it came with was probably the real value.\n\nPole trimmer: returned. Hand saw works fine for most things I found.\n\nCircular saw 2x. Same thing as drill except I was able to return it and just use the smaller and lighter one and haven’t found a reason to need heavier duty.\n\nOscillating Multitool: fine but kinda insist on using it more than needing it but comes in handy.\n\nR",

The washing machine sounds like it was causing some water hammer issues. The hose would make a loud bang during the cycle. Then the next day the dishwasher is running normally and right near the end of the cycle, I hear it beep. Go check it out, h2o error. This happened a few years ago and Reddit helped me figure out the pressure sensor just needed to be cleaned (solved the problem then) so I did that and the h2o error disappeared. However then when I tried to run a cycle, the machine starts up but water doesn’t come in. Also, the light won’t turn on indicating it’s running and when I open the dishwasher mid cycle it doesn’t turn off like it usually does and beep to start again.\n\nI do some research, find it could be the water inlet valve.

Looking for a replacement ASAP. Family of 4 with two very young children and a large doodle. We need something robust that will get our clothes clean. I’ve heard good things about speed queen but the price is a little jarring.\n\nIs a speed queen worth it?\n\nWould you replace both at the same time so they match, or just do the washer for now?\n\nIf not speed queen, what do you recommend? We live in the suburbs of a decently sized city (Cleveland, OH) so I’m not too worried about parts availability or servicing. I don’t care at all about bells and whistles, I just want the thing to clean well and stand the test of time.\n\nThank you!",
