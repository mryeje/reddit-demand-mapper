        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI would like to compare the GSB 65 with the Makita DHP 484 (with metal drill chuck).\n\nThey are roughly the same price. Both cost around €130 with the box.\n\nThe thing is, I found this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dnEKg8MZ94Y](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dnEKg8MZ94Y)\n\nSo I went to OBI (a hardware store) and found that both Makita and Bosch blue had this problem with the models in store.\n\nBut of course, the two models I'm looking for weren't there.\n\nMy Milwaukee ONEPD2 doesn't do this, and an Einhell they also had there, which also has a hammer function, didn't do it either.\n\nSo, to everyone who has these models, I would be grateful if you could check and give me some feedback on whether yours does this too.\n\nThe GSB 65 is quite new, as is the DHP 484 with metal drill chuck.\n\nIf anyone else has any comparative experience with these two models, I would also appreciate hearing about it.",

The reason I didnt replace the Milwaukee with another Milwaukee drill is because all Milwaukee tools I own have very sudden and unpredictable actuation which causes drill bit runaways and wrist torquing at times. I tried the Makita in at my local Berlands and liked how it actuates consistently and predictably. The store even threw in a bonus battery, so I have three Makita 5.0 batteries now!\n\nAnyone else likes Makita's actuation more? Any other specific outstanding Makita tools that beat Milwaukee that I can use these batteries with?",

I tried the Makita in at my local Berlands and liked how it actuates consistently and predictably. The store even threw in a bonus battery, so I have three Makita 5.0 batteries now!\n\nAnyone else likes Makita's actuation more?

The water drips out, wetting the entire surrounding floor.\nI previously displayed an E31/AquaStop error (probably because the water had ended up in the safety tray), but after leaving it idle, the error disappeared. However, the physical leak from the door continues to occur with every cycle.\nDetails found:\nThe leak is located right at the end of the door on the left side.\nThe seals appear clean and in place.\nThere are no obvious blockages in the filters.\nHas anyone with this model had the same problem?\nCould it be the lower seal (the \"brush\" one) or perhaps a micro-crack in the lower spray arm that shoots water sideways?\nBefore calling official support, I'd like to know if it's a component I can easily replace m",

I just want something reliable, no need for fancy features : just washing and drying for at least 10 years. \n\nIs Samsung a good brand, except this one time, I’m usually happy with their products. \n\nI’ve heard good things about LG but they’re very expensive. Hisense are kinda cheap, but should I bet on them on the long term? \n\nI was eyeing a $700 washing machine. Can go up to $1000 if it’s really neeeded and if it’s gonna last loooong. \n\nCould you help?",

Both cost around €130 with the box.\n\nThe thing is, I found this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dnEKg8MZ94Y](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dnEKg8MZ94Y)\n\nSo I went to OBI (a hardware store) and found that both Makita and Bosch blue had this problem with the models in store.\n\nBut of course, the two models I'm looking for weren't there.\n\nMy Milwaukee ONEPD2 doesn't do this, and an Einhell they also had there, which also has a hammer function, didn't do it either.\n\nSo, to everyone who has these models, I would be grateful if you could check and give me some feedback on whether yours does this too.\n\nThe GSB 65 is quite new, as is the DHP 484 with metal drill chuck.\n\nIf anyone else has any comparative experience with these two models, I would also appreciate hearing about it.",

Yes I know a shop vac would be best, but I’ve already got a corded one. \n\nLooks like there are 2 options in production.. PCL704 and PCL705. \n\nThe 704 is a little more expensive but has “2x more suction power” and comes with accessories. I see it also has a wet/dry version, the 702.\n\nSo should I just go with the 704? Is it really as no-brainer as it seems or are there any advantages the 705 has besides price? \n\nAny experiences appreciated. Thanks!",
