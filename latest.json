I feel like I wouldn't mind having the extra tools especially the sander and jig saw, but I feel like I am going to regret not having the brushless tools pretty quickly though. What do you guys think? Are the brushed tools too much of junk to bother with the extra tools? Or is brushless not that big of an upgrade to bother with here? Or are these deals really bad and I should just wait until Ryobi days?",

But let me tell you something for certain, top load washers are garbage technology and you should never buy one again. \n\nLet’s break it down. \n\nWashers use water, soap, and friction to wash clothes.  \n\nAn old school Maytag top loader had a powerful motor that actually was strong enough to beat the tar out of your laundry. It could actually move the clothes and water around effectively, creating enough friction to get out stains. It actually used enough water to create a bath for your clothes too. \n\nNew top Loaders don’t do any of that. They aren’t powerful enough to actually wash your clothes. They use extremely weak motors that cannot achieve what used to be. The government limiting water consumption, as well as tubs getting massive mean clothes barely get wet, let alone clean.

I also really liked the form factor with the small case, which easily fits in a normal backpack. \n\nHowever, after learning about the previous models I noticed the build quality on this one seems quite lower. \n\nI am unsure if I should take it back and spend just a hair more for the 484 and non basic batteries, which seems better built. I’m also skeptical if they really managed to put a stronger motor on this new one that will last a long time. \n\nNot in the trades but I do tackle some nice projects from time to time. I am currently renovating my future record and audio store. ",

Later, when the need arises, I will definitely also buy an angle grinder, jigsaw, leaf blower, multitool and probably some other tools as well.\n\n2.0Ah battery and a charger will be included in the with the grass trimmer. I plan to also buy a 5.0Ah battery, but since I am buying via [amazon.de](http://amazon.de) and they don't ship batteries to my country, I will buy it seperatly.\n\nBefore I buy I would love to get your input on the order.

Just 6,9, 12 ah felxvolt batteries.  The batteries pictured with the blower are actually 12 ah...\n\nThen while looking for some battery deals, I find \"Free Good Included\" as a tag.

I have almost a half acre of woods on my property and do a lot of pruning and clean up every year. Every few years I take down a 60ft tree with my brother in law.\nMy wife is looking to get me a Christmas gift and she suggested a new saw. I currently have an inherited Dolmar PS-540 that runs a little rough but I’m confident given some time I can get it running on top shape.\nMy question is: rather than replace the Dolmar with a Stihl 271 (or similar) is it a better idea to get a smaller saw? I went to a few dealers and the form factor of the Echo 355t as well as the Stihl 194 and 201 seemed great.\nOr is there another option / size that might be a good idea?",
