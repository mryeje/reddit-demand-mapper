There is also an 18v version.\n\nOn an unrelated topic (xD) I’ve wanted to get some nice cordless tools for a while (hammer drill, impact driver, reciprocating multitool, and some fun stuff like a flashlight and USB charger).\n\nSince I’ve had DeWalt corded tools in the past, I kind of always thought I’d go with them (“one of these days”), but since Makita seems to be the only company that sells an upright vacuum in the entire honking Philippines, it seemed like a perfect excuse.\n\nBut how often would I use the heavy vacuum battery on a tool, or the low-capacity tool batteries in the vacuum?

I have flex volt tools and batteries so it is reasonable to buy flexvolt saw. But…\nIt seems to me people really opinionated about this particular saw even among those who like dewalt tools in general. I’ve watched maybe a dozen of videos and I’ve read reviews. Generally it’s “mixed reviews” to say the least. \n\nAs far as I understand main problems are:\n1. **Bad tracks.** But it can run on festool track so I don’t understand why even bother. I can buy festool tracks even cheaper than dewalt ones. So no issues here\n2. **Weird plunge mechanism.** I didn’t try it in person but it looks alright to me. Yeah it’s obviously different from other saws but I sure can live with it. And this is my first track saw ever, so I don’t even need to get used to it really\n3. **Cumbersome blade change.** Many people complain that blade changing on the Dewalt is a major pain.

I immediately went to the big box store websites and looks like most saws in the $500-$700 range are all Jobsite/portable saws. The one catching my eye is the 10” Dewalt DWE7941.\n\nI consider myself a lower intermediate DIY’r with aspirations to one day make something beautiful. My only experience with table saws is w/ the contractor Ridgid saw and I loved how solid and stable it felt cutting longer boards. Would you be happy going from a larger form factor contractor saw to a bench top/portable saw? I know the Dewalt comes with a fold up stand but does using something made for portability give you the same feel as something larger?  \n  \nMy shop is too small for a larger bench style Grizzly so that’s definitely out of the question and price range. I see lots of people who build a workbench around their saw but is the experience of ripping down sheets or using a sled similar? What is your experience using a smaller saw ",

Take your stock wand off and replace with the male to 1/4 quick connect from this kit. You can then put your female to 1/4 quick connect on the stock wand. This will let you put your foam cannons, other wants, tips etc right on the end of the tool rather than out on a wand. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/eRfIhRR\nThis is the stubby wand shown. Works a treat paired with the now shortened tool. \n\nThe quick connect for water can be removed and swapped for the more common quick connects out there. Be advised, it looks like dewalt used a slightly shorter thread height on the otherwise standard GHT. When you screw your standard GHT quick connects in, it will be tight. Screw it in a thread then back out, it will feel like you’re chasing a thread,",

        "selftext": "Hi, first post in this sub. I have had the pleasure of using many 2stroke saws that my father has shared with me, poulan pro, Smaller Husqvarna saws. I own the Kobalt 40v chainsaw and pole saw. I’m a home owner not a homesteader.  I like the battery saws a lot. That brings me to this beast, 94cc  395xp I am working on now. It has a 36” bar. I’m cleaning and fixing it up to re-sell. It was part of an estate auction I won. I’m not keeping it.. (but it’s soo bad ass) I’d love to have any info about it, who might be a buyer (loggers and disaster specialists I’m guessing) and what it is worth. I’m finding them on eBay for over 1k for power head only but is that this saw or a sub model or variant? Looks the same. I’m working on it now, it’s been sitting for a while but I think it’s been used very little, it’s a 2020 model year.\nThanks for any feedback! Happy and Safe Cutting \n",

We had an older washer that flooded our home and did a ton of damage. We bought a whirlpool set with removable agitator in 2021 and last week the washer started to leak. Had someone look at it and the cost to repair it would be not worth it. The auto detergent dispenser had already stopped working and we have to tape the dryer door shut with painter tape because it won’t stay shut so it’s not been a good purchase. They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years.

They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years.

Pressure tested, and pulled a vacuum after. When I go to turn on the unit, the compressors still isn’t pumping refrigerant. The pressures are from the unit is on. What am I overlooking?",
