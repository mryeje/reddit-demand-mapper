        "selftext": "I have finished my Christmas shopping and have assembled my gift to my dad. I went out a little more this year since I have moved away from my hometown for work and have been doing fairly well and finally have the means to give him a nice big gift. Most of his current power tools are 20-25+ years old and either wired or nickel cadmium tools; he doesn't have any modern lithium ion battery systems yet. He does a lot of different home improvement and some light automotive, so I figured i will try to cover as many bases as possible. All of the sockets and bits are Impact rated, except the 6in Bit guide which i learned after purchasing it, hence the presence of the 3in impacted rated version. Additionally the socket set came with an adapted for the impact driver, so essentially everything will work with it. I figure he can keep the impact driver in the garage with his other tools and then the impactt wrench and sockets in the car trunk if he ever needs to change a flat, but I'll leave it up",

We looked up the rental history on it and it only went out on rent 14 times across the 4 years it was in service. \n\nGot two relatively new 5.0ah batteries, charger, and the hard case. The chuck is a little stiff/ bound up but it runs just as well as the brand new XPH14 they replaced it with.\n\nVirtually no runout on it I’m genuinely impressed it’s the first Makita and full size drill I’ve owned. I’m coming from using mainly beat up Milwaukee M18 tools at work so it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nI can’t get over how smooth it is lol.\n\nI’m debating on replacing the chuck with a new Makita chuck from the XPH14 or just getting a Roehm chuck but I’m not sure.",

I feel like that was just bought out of convenience. I think he has a Dewalt one somewhere but I could be wrong. I could not figure out what to get him so I got this. I did some research and brand comparisons but not much. I chose this because it was said to be better ergonomically than a comparable Dewalt drill. I also like that the set comes with 2 batteries and a charger. I know those can be expensive to replace. Did I make a good purchase? ",

My freezer is currently 35° and the refrigerator is hovering around 45°. I put a very detailed explanation into ChatGPT and it did a really good job of walking me through everything to check. Everything was good except for the coils in the freezer. They are clean and shiny except for a heavy amount of frost/ice on the coil that comes into the top to feed the coil condenser rack situation. ChatGPT is suggesting a sealed system failure with the most likely issue being:\n1. Refrigerant leak in evaporator (most common for this Whirlpool-made Kenmore series)\n2. Weak compressor\n3. Capillary tube partial blockage (rarer but possible)\n\nMy question for the pros out there…\nWhat would you rec",

I schedule a service on Maytag's website which is suspiciously cancelled after about 3 hours.  I schedule again, same result.  I call Maytag service and listen to their hold music for over an hour before I get ahold of someone... after being bumped around two three different people it turns out that despite the website saying that I am within their service area I am, in fact, not.  They offer to give me a credit for ordering parts... so much for \"parts and service\".  I order the part and install, machine starts working again.  Ended up being out of commission for over two weeks due to miscommunications from Maytag.\n\n  \nIssue #2: December 2025 - No more spin cycle.

The chuck is a little stiff/ bound up but it runs just as well as the brand new XPH14 they replaced it with.\n\nVirtually no runout on it I’m genuinely impressed it’s the first Makita and full size drill I’ve owned. I’m coming from using mainly beat up Milwaukee M18 tools at work so it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nI can’t get over how smooth it is lol.\n\nI’m debating on replacing the chuck with a new Makita chuck from the XPH14 or just getting a Roehm chuck but I’m not sure.",

I'm planning on buying a Ryobi brand reciprocating saw for my mom this Christmas; however, I'm struggling a bit on whether I should get the HP 18V brushless(?) cordless saw, or the 18V saw. I don't understand the difference between each saw. I know she would mostly use the saw to prune a palm tree we have in our front yard, which one would be best for this? I'm also looking into replacement blades. From what I've read, they don't have to be Ryobi brand, but they do have to fit the saw. Does anyone have a preferred brand for the replacement blades that might be cheaper than Ryobi's? I came to Reddit for these questions since I don't have anyone else to ask. I'm not very knowledgeable about tools, and I'm sorry if any of my questions are stupid. Thank you!!",

He does a lot of different home improvement and some light automotive, so I figured i will try to cover as many bases as possible. All of the sockets and bits are Impact rated, except the 6in Bit guide which i learned after purchasing it, hence the presence of the 3in impacted rated version. Additionally the socket set came with an adapted for the impact driver, so essentially everything will work with it.

I double checked everything was good in regards to overcrowding and blocking airflow. The problem seemed to slowly just get worse over the past week or so. My freezer is currently 35° and the refrigerator is hovering around 45°. I put a very detailed explanation into ChatGPT and it did a really good job of walking me through everything to check. Everything was good except for the coils in the freezer. They are clean and shiny except for a heavy amount of frost/ice on the coil that comes into the top to feed the coil condenser rack situation. ChatGPT is suggesting a sealed system failure with the most likely issue being:\n1. Refrigerant leak in evaporator (most common for this Whirlpool-made Kenmore series)\n2. Weak compressor\n3. Capillary tube partial blockage (rarer but possible)\n\nMy question for the pros out there…\nWhat would you rec",

I schedule a service on Maytag's website which is suspiciously cancelled after about 3 hours.  I schedule again, same result.  I call Maytag service and listen to their hold music for over an hour before I get ahold of someone... after being bumped around two three different people it turns out that despite the website saying that I am within their service area I am, in fact, not.  They offer to give me a credit for ordering parts... so much for \"parts and service\".  I order the part and install, machine starts working again.  Ended up being out of commission for over two weeks due to miscommunications from Maytag.\n\n  \nIssue #2: December 2025 - No more spin cycle.

Five years later, it is out again. Top is refrigerator and bottom is the freezer. Neither works.\n\nModel: LFXC24726S\n\nLG compressors do not last more than 5 years.\n\nI have been told it will cost as much to fix as a new refrigerator. Is this true?

We looked up the rental history on it and it only went out on rent 14 times across the 4 years it was in service. \n\nGot two relatively new 5.0ah batteries, charger, and the hard case. The chuck is a little stiff/ bound up but it runs just as well as the brand new XPH14 they replaced it with.\n\nVirtually no runout on it I’m genuinely impressed it’s the first Makita and full size drill I’ve owned. I’m coming from using mainly beat up Milwaukee M18 tools at work so it’s an interesting comparison.\n\nI can’t get over how smooth it is lol.\n\nI’m debating on replacing the chuck with a new Makita chuck from the XPH14 or just getting a Roehm chuck but I’m not sure.",

The grass is dying, patchy, plants are overgrown and just looking to take care of it. \n\nI’ve no idea in terms of tools but to start off (with budget items in mind), I’m thinking the Ryobi one plus set (mower, wacker, blower)? Sure the battery might not last long but it’s a pretty small yard.. unless any one else have any other recs? \n\nAlso for the grass, I’m not sure where to start in terms of reviving if possible or seed on patchy parts. Which seeds and tools are recommended? On the passion fruit vine, I plan on either removing it all or just trimming the heck out of it. Thinking loppers might do the trick?\n\nI’m in Southern California for reference\n\nThanks! \n\n",

It’s ivory travertine tile, glass door, probably a fiberglass pan, with an exposed shower system (Grohe rain head + handheld).\n\nWhat’s happened so far:\n\n* When I moved in in the Spring, I noticed some discoloration on a tile just **outside the shower**. We had plumbers come in to re-siliconed the pan (not sure if they did a great job though since it already looks a bit worn off). They also checked for cracks in the pan but didn't find any.\n* Around November, I noticed discoloration on the bottom row of tiles **inside the shower**. It may have been slowly developing before but I didn't really notice it until then.\n* I've stopped using the shower since then (I have a second one) and ran a dehumidifier. The inside-shower discoloration has lightened slightly but is still visible.\n\nI’m not sure what’s causing the issues inside the shower. Could",

The self-emptying base has been a huge help. yeah, there's a quick burst of noise, but it beats having dust fly everywhere when I'm trying to empty it myself. and honestly, the biggest win is I'm sneezing less after vacuuming.   \n  \nMinor tradeoffs,  \n  \nYou still need to empty the base dustbin every couple weeks or so.
