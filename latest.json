        "selftext": "Rant here. \n\nIn early May 2025 I sent my lawnmower model RY401017 to a repair shop that works with Ryobi. It was an hour and a half from me but I made the drive. Something in the lawnmower had gone bad and was causing the two middle lights on the battery to blink and would never start. Multiple batteries were tried. \n\nRyobi sent my repair shop the wrong part 3 different times, then claimed they had to wait 3 months for the correct parts (after the shop had my unit for over 4 months already).
