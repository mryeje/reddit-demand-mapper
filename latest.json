Never used dewalt either\n\nI currently use metabo (germany) and im pretty happy with them for my line of work (electrician). \nFrom them Currently i own 4 batteries, an sds drill, combi drill and impact driver.\nSo far ive invested about £700 over about 6 months. Not cheap but they perform really really well.\n\nWas looking at the list of tools i have left to buy, (multi tool, angle grinder and possibly circular saw)\nAnd i realised im actually paying out my ass for bare tools here. And those are lower end models, not that the high end models are any better either.\n\nSo i looked at makita for their multi tool, ive used it breifly before and it was actually very comfortable and ergonomic, vs the milwaukee n dewalt.\n\nThen i looked at the grinder and circular saw. They were decently priced too.\nBatteries were priced similarly unless i looked at metabos LIHD offerings.\n\n\nAnyway my only gripe is how lackluster som",

I’m a DIYer living on a small farm so I get lots of different projects all the time. I’ve never missed the hammer function on my DDF484 but the times I’ve had to drill in concrete I’ve always wipped out the corded blue Bosch rotary hammer and never the old corded hammer drill. Is there any situation where I would miss the hammer function? Professional tradesmen that need to drill small holes in masonry of course get use of the hammer function without having to use one more tool but for someone that very rarely drills in masonry and rock/concrete - should I stick with the DF001G? At first I got the DF001G because I thought it was lighter and smaller but after further research it seems as if the HP",

We had an older washer that flooded our home and did a ton of damage. We bought a whirlpool set with removable agitator in 2021 and last week the washer started to leak. Had someone look at it and the cost to repair it would be not worth it. The auto detergent dispenser had already stopped working and we have to tape the dryer door shut with painter tape because it won’t stay shut so it’s not been a good purchase. They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years.

I know it’s still new but just doesn’t sit right.. rather pay 80-110$ more for one that is only a couple months from authorized dealer. \n\nNow that I’m returning it I started thinking though - should I get the HP001G instead of the DF001G? I’m a DIYer living on a small farm so I get lots of different projects all the time. I’ve never missed the hammer function on my DDF484 but the times I’ve had to drill in concrete I’ve always wipped out the corded blue Bosch rotary hammer and never the old corded hammer drill. Is there any situation where I would miss the hammer function? Professional tradesmen that need to drill small holes in masonry of course get use of the hammer function without having to use one more tool but for someone that very rarely drills in masonry and rock/concrete - should I stick with the DF001G? At first I got the DF001G because I thought it was lighter and smaller but after further research it seems as if the HP",

Had someone look at it and the cost to repair it would be not worth it. The auto detergent dispenser had already stopped working and we have to tape the dryer door shut with painter tape because it won’t stay shut so it’s not been a good purchase. They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years.

I’m cleaning and fixing it up to re-sell. It was part of an estate auction I won. I’m not keeping it.. (but it’s soo bad ass) I’d love to have any info about it, who might be a buyer (loggers and disaster specialists I’m guessing) and what it is worth. I’m finding them on eBay for over 1k for power head only but is that this saw or a sub model or variant? Looks the same. I’m working on it now, it’s been sitting for a while but I think it’s been used very little, it’s a 2020 model year.\nThanks for any feedback! Happy and Safe Cutting \n",

We had an older washer that flooded our home and did a ton of damage. We bought a whirlpool set with removable agitator in 2021 and last week the washer started to leak. Had someone look at it and the cost to repair it would be not worth it. The auto detergent dispenser had already stopped working and we have to tape the dryer door shut with painter tape because it won’t stay shut so it’s not been a good purchase. They were washer WTW8127LW0 and dryer WED5100HW1)\n\nSo we need a new machine like now but I’m so so overwhelmed by all the brands, finding if they are good or not, etc. I’m so stressed out. \n\nMy friend has been saying she wanted a speed queen for years. I see speed queen stuff all over but I thought my whirlpool would last longer. \n\nI had been looking for an older washer/dryer set but usually they were s",

Our new place had some brand-new Bosch or GE but my wife wanted to swap and keep the Miele. So I did. No joke here, the Miele weighs literally twice as much as any other dishwasher.\n\nThe other week, it started showing signs of finally being ready to go - cycles failing, fault codes etc. To my surprise, despite being 20 years old, Miele still makes parts for it. Not only that, but the full 200+ page service manual is published online, detailing exactly how to check fault codes and what each code means, how to access every part, circuit diagrams, water flow diagrams, etc. The parts definitely aren't being sold completely at cost but they're not egregious either.\n\nThe issue turned out to be some O-rings that disintegrated on a valve on the sump, causing the drain pump to",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit - I'l looking for someone to suggest a leaf blower and Strimmer from the Makita lineup.\n\nWe are about 1/2 acre of garden area, all relatively wild - not very neat lawns etc... Want a semi-decent blower for all the leaves coming off the trees aswell as the HUGE amount of acorns we have this year!\n\nThe strimmer will be for overgrown grass, nettles, brambles and the likes, not as much for edge-ing the lawn, so again something semi-decent.\n\nThere is so much in their lineup I just get abit lost! Any advice welcomed, thanks!\n\nEDIT: UK Post",

        "selftext": "We recently had a water leak (thankfully fixed now), but part of the repair involved removing drywall,  releasing an old, nasty smoke smell from the previous owners. The house always had a bit of that odor, but now it’s way stronger and pretty unbearable.\n\nOur church offered to let us borrow their ozone generator to help get rid of the smell. At the same time, the restoration crew we hired still has dehumidifiers and a couple of fans running to heat and dry out the area so we don’t end up with mold under the floors.\n\nWe’re not currently living in the house while all this is going on, and the AC system is turned off. So my question is: is it safe to run the ozone generator while those other machines are operating, as long as no one’s inside? I just don’t want to risk damaging the equipment or create any unsafe conditions.\n\nAny info on ozone generators, general advice, or firsthand experience would be super appreciated. We’re first time homeowners and learning as we go here!",

The biggest part is the kitchen which includes taking down a few walls. They've already gutted the walls down to the studs and today they actually take down the walls. They have put up plastic all around the kitchen and I leave the house during their working hours. I try to keep the windows open, we have an air purifier, they vacuum when theyre done and I do an extra round when they leave just to get the thin layer of dust left behind. What else should I be doing? Should I even sleep here at night? We have a 6 year old as well. Should I be wearing a mask even when they're not here, but when I'm relaxing at night? I just want to keep myself safe but I don't think I can move myself out of the house completely. ",
