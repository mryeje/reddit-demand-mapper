But LG models seem to have newer features like QuadWash, better Wi-Fi integration, and sometimes a lower price for similar specs.\n\nIf you’ve used both brands, could you share your experience on:\n\t•\tReliability (any service calls or breakdowns?)\n\t•\tDrying performance (especially for plastics)\n\t•\tNoise levels\n\t•\tEase of maintenance or cleaning filters\n\t•\tAny regrets or strong recommendations?\n\nTrying to figure out if Bosch is still worth the premium or if LG has caught up in 2025.\n\nThanks in advance — all real-world experiences appreciated!",

Using all the paslode recommended products for cleaning and oiling. The nails are the correct 30° paper collated .131 nails. \n\nIt shot like 15 racks of nails perfectly, then started intermittently doing this. The driver seems to be slipping and missing the nail, plunging itself into the lumber. I bought this used so I don’t have high expectations, but I took it apart, aside from taking the retaining ring and piston out. The piston/driver has movement which makes me think the rings could be worn down. Anyways, would you send this to paslode to be serviced/repaired, or",

But LG models seem to have newer features like QuadWash, better Wi-Fi integration, and sometimes a lower price for similar specs.\n\nIf you’ve used both brands, could you share your experience on:\n\t•\tReliability (any service calls or breakdowns?)\n\t•\tDrying performance (especially for plastics)\n\t•\tNoise levels\n\t•\tEase of maintenance or cleaning filters\n\t•\tAny regrets or strong recommendations?\n\nTrying to figure out if Bosch is still worth the premium or if LG has caught up in 2025.\n\nThanks in advance — all real-world experiences appreciated!",

After months of comparing Luba 2, Segway Navimow, and Anthbot Genie, I finally went with the Genie 3000 - mainly because I was done repairing broken boundary wires on my old Worx.\n\n\n\nSetup & Build\n\nSetup was way easier than I expected. The box comes with the mower, dock, RTK “mushroom” antenna, cables, extra blades, tools, and an actually useful quick-start guide (rare).\n\n All I did was:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug in the dock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMount the RTK antenna somewhere with a clear sky view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPair via Bluetooth in the app\n\n\n\n\n\nFirmware took \\~15 min to update (needed solid Wi-Fi for that), but after that, it’s been fine even at the far end of my backyard. The mower feels premium — solid body, sturdy wheels, and it has an IPX6 waterproof rating, allowing you to safely rinse it with a regular garden h",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI’m torn between getting an LG or a Bosch dishwasher and would love to hear from people who’ve owned either (or both).\n\nI’ve seen a ton of love for Bosch, especially the 500 and 800 Series — quiet operation, CrystalDry, and long-term reliability. But LG models seem to have newer features like QuadWash, better Wi-Fi integration, and sometimes a lower price for similar specs.\n\nIf you’ve used both brands, could you share your experience on:\n\t•\tReliability (any service calls or breakdowns?)\n\t•\tDrying performance (especially for plastics)\n\t•\tNoise levels\n\t•\tEase of maintenance or cleaning filters\n\t•\tAny regrets or strong recommendations?\n\nTrying to figure out if Bosch is still worth the premium or if LG has caught up in 2025.\n\nThanks in advance — all real-world experiences appreciated!",

I would have to separate the washing machine load into two, the jeans and the lighter stuff.  And all in all, with both loads, talking about 4 hours.  And it would be \"dry\" and stop, then I'd have to keep adding time.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to get a vented unit to replace it.  But the only options were GE, and Samsung.  I am a bit leery of Samsung appliances.  And GE's reviews were good, but something made me hold back.\n\nSo I ended up with a Miele set.  And I've heard all sorts of bad reviews about how my clothes were going to be wet, etc.\n\nThe washing machine spins at 1600 so a lot of stuff comes out relatively dry feeling compared to the Blomberg but still in need of drying.\n\nI got the cheapest T1, with the solid white door.\n\nIt's a louder unit than I thought it was going to be.  But instead of separating my clothes",

The driver seems to be slipping and missing the nail, plunging itself into the lumber. I bought this used so I don’t have high expectations, but I took it apart, aside from taking the retaining ring and piston out. The piston/driver has movement which makes me think the rings could be worn down. Anyways, would you send this to paslode to be serviced/repaired, or",
