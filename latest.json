So I opened her up, replaced the belt, drum rollers, and idler pulley while I was vacuuming up any lint/dirt out of the machine. I also replaced all of the venting between the dryer and the outside wall (only 2.5 feet).\n\n\nDryer still doesn't dry well. Looked through the peephole and saw that gas ignited, so we have flame at least. But the heating cycles were only lasting 2 mins, and I observed a pattern of 2 minutes of flame with about 1 minute no flame. My understanding is that to get the dryer initially hot it would probably be on for around 8 mins and then cycle on/off every couple of minutes from that point onward. \n\nSo I thought it might be the thermal fuse or high limit thermostat malfunctioning telling the burner to quit early, so I ended up replacing those along with the cycling thermostat. Still nothing. \n\nThought it might be the blower fan was cracked or slippin",

A voltage detector confirms power is present at the dishwasher wiring.\n\nStrangely, twice in the last two weeks the dishwasher randomly powered back on for \\~15 minutes:\n\n\t•\tFirst time: I flipped the breaker to reset it, and it never came back on\n\n\t•\tSecond time: I tried starting a cycle; it ran briefly, then died again mid-cycle\n\nSince then, it’s been completely unresponsive.\n\nBosch service can’t come for several weeks.

What’s the point of having all these AWS tools if they won’t sell the Vac to adapt them. The other vacuums are too big (and expensive) to buy but this one is ideal.\n\nDo we think they will carry them soon? Or should I just buy it online and where? Shipping for this will kill me with tariffs…\n\nHow much more would the AWS version run than the current non-AWS version?\n\nI can’t even be sure I have the correct model number but I think this is right? Comes with the wheels (which I can get here so doesn’t have to be this version just that’s what I could find as an example and the model number order is different outside the U.S. so I didn’t want to cut the wrong part.\n\nIf the non-AWS had a plug for my AWS adapter that lets me use wired vacs that would be a work-around. But from what I can see it doesn’t have a plug to connect it to power the adapter and trigger the vac to start. ",
