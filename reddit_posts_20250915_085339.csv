Makita,Makita Chainsaw ‚Äî bar oil?,"Hi fellow Makitans.

I have loved Makita tools for as long as I can remember owning tools.  I have a big blue flotilla of Makita cordless gizmos as well as some corded.  Some are well over 20 years old and still going strong.

Most recently I decided to kick the gas chainsaw habit and get a Makita battery chainsaw.  Nice solid feeling tool and not too difficult to assemble, though tensioning the chain is a little fiddly.  They didn‚Äôt send enough bar oil with the saw for the first fill up, as far",11,13,1757298039.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Makita/comments/1nbbtwu/makita_chainsaw_bar_oil/,https://reddit.com/r/Makita/comments/1nbbtwu/makita_chainsaw_bar_oil/,"['advice', 'new to']","['chainsaw', 'battery', 'cordless']"
